# PadMint status

PadMint was named PadForge until 0.2.0 (padforge#25); older entries below use
the current name.

Resumable record for the overnight goal loop. Source of truth for decisions and
per-repo state is the Notion "Public Repo Proprietary-Content Audit" and its
tracker; this file mirrors progress so work can resume after interruption.

## Current continuation (1 Oct)

- Blank progress display reproduced: existing heartbeat status and warning
  reason were recorded but omitted from console output. Three-line fallback
  now shows those existing fields, preserving backend stage/count display,
  JSON event schema, runner behavior, timings, private logs and release gates.
  Portable synthetic regression exercises real execute/record paths, not a
  game build. Final full191tests PASS separately Apple3.9(37.503s)/Python3.11
  (38.314s); extracted development Mac ZIP29 player/recovery/display tests
  PASS(14.268s). Development ZIPs retain0.2.8 label, not published assets.
  All3ZIPs/both changed-file scans PASS; frozen0.2.9 draft03b untouched.
  ExistingWindows package job includes new regression; existing stagedLinux
  package-check pattern reused here. Hosted checks await this draft push;
  latest terminal status belongs in PR#71/Notion, not a release claim.

- Player-first checkpoint: published PadMint0.2.8 from the verified Mac ZIP
  completed a fresh HarkinianPad0.2.0/build7 source/backend cache with two jobs
  in2134.81s. Already-provisioned Mac, not a fresh host; backend PATH Python3.14.

- Hark#35 exact5a3ad74 hosted36848255000 SUCCESS:19tests/full unsigned iOS
  build/import/package/signature rejection. Artifact not separately downloaded;
  missing-library fix remains draft and public recipe unchanged.
- Golden#49 now08ef660 honors selected build limits across required generation,
  runtime, RT64 device/simulator and Xcode helpers; old unset/empty behavior kept.
  Main independently reviewed/replayed12 fixtures plus5 source-archive tests,
  separately Apple3.9/Python3.11; actual source/ROM guards and both sourceZIP
  scans PASS. Pushed OPEN/DRAFT, not hosted/app/device/publication acceptance.
- Fresh issue sweep: PadMint no open issues, Windows/Golden reporters already
  confirmed success. New Kart#378 is controller mapping, owned by Kart app agent.
  Phone-only storage/no-Mac paths still incomplete. Blank progress messages in
  this cold build are a concrete next UX fix, separate from frozen0.2.9 candidate.
  Banana/Spaghetti parked; no extra micro-fix agents or release this checkpoint.

- Required build-limit follow-up: DinoPad#12 now cb0ea77 honors the selected
  limit in host tools and MIPS patches, retaining manual precedence/default4
  and the generic Python3.9 fix. Two real-entrypoint fixtures reproduced4vs2;
  all16 fixture tests PASS separately Apple3.9/Python3.11. Independent review
  repeats16 tests each plus34 helper cases; real safety/patch/reference checks,
  production-byte invariants and both committed-source scans PASS. Optional
  SDL/restoration helpers remain outside this fix; no real game generation.
- PaperPad#16 now9ce10f6 passes the standard limit to PaperBoat device/simulator
  CMake while retaining manual precedence/default8. Eight tests PASS both
  interpreters; independent review reproduces baseline8vs2 and repeats tests.
  Pin-check stops, configuration, signing/provenance and other production bytes
  are unchanged. Exact hosted source36842927738 SUCCESS: pins/repository/input
  checks, not a full game app or execution of the new focused job fixtures.
- BearBirdPad#23 nowb2192f2 honors the standard limit in required host tools,
  otherwise retaining the exact CPU/default4 fallback. Eight focused tests
  (33 fixture cases) PASS both interpreters; main independent replay/byte
  invariants/source guards PASS. Exact hosted36842929623 SUCCESS: pinned host
  tools, ROM-free Simulator stub and package/audit. Artifact not independently
  downloaded; not a full game or fresh-player-host/device acceptance.
- DevilTouch#10 nowda768fd passes the standard limit to signed/unsigned Xcode,
  keeping the manual JOBS override/default8. Six focused tests (100 fixture
  cases) and the complete11-test repository suite PASS both interpreters;
  main independent replay/configure/source/signing/packaging invariants PASS.
  Exact hosted source36842931502 SUCCESS: source/test/content guards, not app.
- All four existing OPEN/DRAFT heads are pushed and read back; production
  syntax/diff/safety and both exact committed-source scans PASS. Paper's scan
  retains one previously allowed source stub, not a zero-symbol/rights claim.
  No primary, pin, recipe, version, public asset or signing/input change; no
  new personal app/fresh-player-host/device/gameplay/rights/publication proof.
- Bounded15-root manifest/helper audit found five remaining explicit compile
  overrides: Melee, Sun, Golden, Spaghetti and Banana. BlueWake additionally
  hardcodes8 translation workers in required mod preparation. These are
  concrete next fixes, not evidence that all other/transitive paths are capped.
  Bell/Mask/Hark/Starship/Anne/Brawler have no confirmed default numeric
  override in the inspected first-party paths; runtime readiness is unproven.
  Larger host-library provisioning/Age-profile choices remain owner discussions.
  KartPad app fixes remain with the other agent; no new issue reply/test ask.
- Docs head46781e7 exact Windows36843776566 SUCCESS: bundledPadMint0.2.8
  launches,28 player/recovery tests PASS (67.938s), all3 ZIP scans PASS.
  Checkout is PR mergea4796c7 into main27dc9ecb, not a release commit or this
  later terminal-status edit's execution proof; artifacts not downloaded.
- BallPad#14 now ac90603 honors PadMint's existing parallel-build limit in
  engine CMake and FFmpeg make, which previously overrode it with hw.ncpu.
  Manual unset/empty retains its prior CPU default; invalid limits fail before
  tools, output setup, downloads or engine operations. Eight command-fixture
  tests PASS Apple3.9/Python3.11; independent review PASS plus26 supplemental
  full-entry/guard cases. Source-validator failure remains fail-closed. Main
  actual maintained-source identity/cleanliness/commit/tree/ancestry check PASS.
  Exact rewrite proof preserves all other production bytes, pins, recipe,
  version and packaging; both changed-file/tracked-source scans PASS. No
  hosted workflow or new app/device/fresh-host/gameplay/rights/publication proof.
  Developer-only probe and recipient relink scripts are outside this job fix.
- Required-shell follow-up covers Bell/Dino16 frozen route files and10 required
  Python snippets, all parse/compile on Apple3.9. Main Ball/Barrel12 frozen
  shell-file check additionally parses two required Barrel JSON readers and
  its previously unscanned viewport test; Ball's optional JSON-reader definition
  also parses. Not runtime/transitive/native/app acceptance.
- DinoPad#12 now c04ebba accepts generic Python only after an actual>=3.9
  version check, keeping existing versioned preference. Seven real-entrypoint
  fixtures PASS separately Apple3.9/Python3.11; independent review PASS,
  including Apple-only PATH reaching the missing-MIPS gate with no output.
  All production bytes outside selection and pins/recipe/version unchanged.
  Complete safety/patch/reference checks and both changed-file/committed-source
  scans PASS. Tracked ZIP a2ec63095e4adf0a99f4a069e0c7f5a2099466d9f428120e7bf822355e86b191.
- BarrelPad#18 now07a5023 honors the standard PadMint limit for engine/SDL.
  Existing nonempty manual override precedes CMake limit then CPU default;
  invalid selected values stop before unit/source/download/output work.
  Ten actual-entrypoint fixture tests PASS bothApple3.9/Python3.11, main
  independently reviewed/replayed; real input/PAL viewport/presentation suite
  PASS. Exact permitted-rewrite invariants preserve all other entrypoint bytes.
  Repository safety/syntax/diff and both tracked-source scans PASS; ZIP
  2b5d10ed64568420b99907ab071d143b588158ab9c175d796f628997ca809da4.
  No clone behavior, recipe, pin, version, SDK, packaging or data-guard change.
- Both fixes are pushed on existing OPEN/DRAFTs with body/head readback;
  published0.2.0 recipes/assets remain unchanged. No hosted workflows, new
  game/dependency/app builds, fresh-player-host, device/gameplay/rights or
  publication acceptance. KartPad app work stays with the other agent.
- Melee36833475426 is now SUCCESS for a9da335: source suite and full iOS app
  compile without private game inputs; final dependency cleanliness PASS.
  Actual PR merge333d6b0 into publicmain8bf86d7, Xcode16.4; no independent
  artifact/fresh-player-host/device/gameplay/rights acceptance. Earlier pending
  statements below are historical checkpoints, not current live jobs.
- MeleePad#39 now a9da335 fixes the required Slippi helper's Python3.9 hashing
  failure with equivalent bounded streaming SHA256. Eight focused tests PASS
  on Apple3.9 and Python3.11, including the five unchanged real Git source
  identity guards. The complete default repository suite PASSes separately on
  both interpreters; required dependency pins remain clean. Independent review
  PASS; all other production AST statements, pins, recipe and version unchanged.
  Both changed-file/tracked-source scans PASS. Exact hosted36833475426 source
  checks SUCCESS, full iOS build still running. This is not a new personal app,
  physical gameplay, fresh-player-host or rights/publication acceptance.
- Remaining five frozen public releases received a bounded Python3.9 helper
  scan: AgePad0.1.0 (one required inject entry), BallPad1.1.1 (13 files),
  BellPad0.2.0 (5), BarrelPad0.2.0 (1), DinoPad0.2.0 (11). All31 files parse
  under Apple3.9; no targeted newer-API or eager-union-annotation suspects.
  This is static evidence only: no runtime/transitive/native/app readiness
  claim. Required shell snippets and optional Age tools are not covered.
  Age's updated Steam profile and complete host-library preflight/provisioning
  remain owner discussions; no new platform, release or backend behavior.
- GoldenPad#49 now90160c5 adds a bounded Python3.9 source-archive compatibility
  fix. Checker/exporter used3.11-only hashlib.file_digest; five fixture tests
  failed onApple3.9 beforefix, passed3.11, and nowPASSboth with streamed1MiB
  SHA256. Corruption/missingfile/link rejection, trackedonly fixture export,
  exactmanifest/checksum, exportedverification and deterministicrepeat PASS.
  Main AST reconstruction confirms every other production statement unchanged;
  realpins/recipe/version/AGENTS unchanged. Both changedfile/trackedsource scans,
  ROM and diff checks PASS. Normal Git-source verification was unaffected.
  ExacttrackedZIP93270c06bced8820ae6671283d05349a5b1bc9187facead1d329d1197e86aea5.
  Source-tool fixture proof only, no realfull dependency export, hostedworkflow,
  app/freshhost/device/rights/publication acceptance. Independent review PASS,
  replaying all5 tests and AST proof onbothinterpreters at the exactclean head.
- SunPad#53 exact4639580 hosted36828287631 now SUCCESS, safety/source suite plus
  iOS/tvOS dependency preparation and runtime/app compilation without game inputs.
  Main read both BUILD SUCCEEDED log records. Not completed privategame-module
  IPA, guidedPadMint freshhost, signing/device/gameplay/rights acceptance.
  Hark PR check36828210095 for5d2d3f5 now SUCCESS: full unsignediPhoneOS
  app,18maintainedtests, packimport/selection and package/signed-rejection checks.
  Checkout is PR merge3d78af09b3998e2d9e273a5ed7300997d3a0ee2d, not a new
  branch/release commit. CI configureddeployment14 and installs native hostlibs;
  not source-default15/newdevice/minOS/freshplayerhost or publiccontent clearance.
  Artifact inventory only observed, not downloaded/readback audited.
- Bounded eight-game Python3.9 helper audit found one additional required-path
  bug in publicMelee0.2.1 and retaineddraft: build-slippi-rust.py digest uses
  hashlib.file_digest through literalpython3. Exactfunction synthetic3.9 failure
  and3.11 control reproduced, no actualRust/appfailure claimed. Fixed in the
  current Melee draft above, preserving Rust/provenance/source guards.
  Otherseven inspectedfirstparty wrappers show no
  concrete additional incompatibility; transitiveengine/tool and remaining
  Age/Ball/Bell/Barrel/Dino helper scan now recorded above, not exhaustive readiness.
- Eight-repo linked-install-doc audit found five current-route contradictions;
  small fixes are pushed on existing drafts, with public assets unchanged:
  HarkinianPad#35 at5d2d3f5 now installs the completed personal PadMint IPA,
  distinguishes current source15/identity0.2.0-build7 from old Preview6/CI14,
  and fixes bundled Mac Python3.9 hashing in the provenance writer. Previously
  three tests failed on hashlib.file_digest; streaming SHA256 passes empty,
  small and multi-chunk parity. All18 tests PASS on Apple3.9/Python3.11;
  report/check logic unchanged by AST comparison. BlueWake#11 ate47cd95
  requires25GBfree, matching the unchanged recipe, not a measured peak guarantee.
  GoldenPad#49 at65c14bd identifies0.2.2/build15 recipe-only release and completed
  personal IPA, scoping old packaging/private Mac downloads to history.
  Main's five cross-guide/link/recipe/guard/hash-invariant checks PASS on both
  interpreters; repository/diff/both exact tracked-source scans PASS.
  PaperPad#16 at9e852fd routes current PaperBoat/iOS16.3 personal IPA rather
  than Original's retired Preview2; separate bundle IDs/saves remain explicit.
  SunPad#53 at4639580 distinguishes the public shell from the complete private
  module-bearing IPA, preserving nested signing/import/save warnings; tvOS stays
  private source-development, no public download or PadMint tvOS recipe invented.
  Main independently reviewed four docs and replayed12 portable checks on both
  interpreters plus both tracked-source scans PASS. All recipe/backend/host/
  version/signing/device and historical acceptance boundaries preserved except
  Hark's equivalent hash operation. Exact Blue36828211079 repository audit and
  Paper36828287576 source-integrity SUCCESS. Hark36828210095 source/controller
  checks and Sun36828287631 safety/source suite PASS, full app jobs pending.
  No new app/device/fresh-host/rights/publication acceptance. Other Kart agent
  owns recent app reports; PadMint open issues remain empty, no duplicate reply.
- Two contradictory installation docs corrected in drafts, with regression tests:
  DevilTouch#10 at5106aea accurately separates the public preview's minimum iOS13
  from current-source default15 and removes stale no-public-IPA wording. Five
  tests PASS Apple3.9/Python3.11; independent historical-source/actual-public-IPA
  review PASS; source safety and both changed-file/tracked-source scans PASS.
  Exact-head hosted source36823793109 SUCCESS. No app/release/support change.
  VaultPad#10 nowf6c7a3f additionally corrects docs/INSTALL.md's retired-download
  notice and names the existing unsigned preview's canonical tag. Source build
  is optional, recipient signing still required. Six tests PASS both interpreters
  and independent review; production build/recipe/workflow unchanged from2c44fd1,
  both changed-file/tracked-source scans PASS. Exact full hosted36824160065
  SUCCESS: six regressions, fresh engine-resource/Simulator/device builds and
  unsigned package. Earlier2c44 hosted36822580772 also SUCCESS. Both real CI
  artifacts downloaded once and independently verified: GitHub outer digests,
  exact IPA checksums, actual0.1.0/build1/minOS15/iPad-only/arm64/unsigned,
  minimal structure and both content scans PASS. Xcode16.4/SDK18.5 evidence,
  not PadMint guided fresh-host/Xcode27 cold-resource/device/gameplay/rights proof;
  previous warm app-build evidence belongs to2c44fd1, not this docs head.
  All existing signing/private-input/save/device-acceptance limits retained.
- Three see-repo backend rechecks through actual public PadMint0.2.8 completed:
  SnapPad retained draft#7 at779583e (71.57s), DevilTouch current main1f50702
  (183.19s), VaultPad new draft#10 at2c44fd1 (11.54s). Actual IPA/record/source/
  recipe/version/unsigned/minimal-structure readbacks pass. Snap's full personal
  IPA correctly fails both content scans with4880 address-named functions and
  remains private; Devil/Vault scans pass but outputs remain personal-only.
  This is warm-cache build evidence, not public guided-recipe availability,
  fresh-host readiness, new device/gameplay or rights acceptance. Snap remains
  formally L0 pending source-stub policy. Devil's current personal minimum iOS15
  differs from the existing published preview's minimum13; public assets unchanged.
- VaultPad#10 forwards PadMint's existing parallel limit to raw xcodebuild;
  actual build log confirms -jobs2. Five synthetic regression tests PASS on
  Apple3.9/Python3.11, independently repeated; repository verification,
  unchanged-tail review and both changed-file/tracked-source scans PASS.
  Previous fixed IPA/checksum/app copied and verified before replacement.
  Hosted full Simulator/package run36822580772 now passes at2c44fd1;
  separate doc-follow-up full run36824160065 also passes atf6c7a3f.
  Existing warm ce.dat bypasses the host configure branch. No aggregate worker
  cap, cold-resource, device or publication claim. Primary/signing untouched.
- Fresh issue sweep: PadMint has no open issues. New KartPad#376 is graphics,
  outside this loop's app-fix ownership; no duplicate reply/test request sent.
  Known phone-only storage and fresh-host tool setup remain larger owner choices.
- Owner scope update: this loop now owns PadMint and non-KartPad build compatibility.
  A different agent owns KartPad app bugs. Builder reports in KartPad issues remain
  in scope, but no new rendering/runtime diagnostics or repeated player test asks.
  Small checked fixes can proceed; major process/UX changes need owner discussion.
- Non-offered catalog follow-up: DevilTouch and VaultPad already have public
  engine-app previews, so their existing unsigned IPAs do not need a PadMint
  personal build. One anonymous download each matches its published checksum
  and GitHub digest; exact package metadata and both released0.2.8/reference
  content scans PASS. DevilTouch1.5.5/build2 supports iPhone+iPad; VaultPad0.1.0/
  build1 is iPad-only. Both releases are non-draft prereleases. Their latest API
  endpoints return404, but canonical preview pages return200; web/latest was
  not tested. README now points to the explicit existing previews, not a new
  recipe/platform/release or rights/device acceptance claim.
- SnapPad#8 stages corrected README download status and bounded IPA audit
  messages at a44cef86e2a1d4d6073d907ac49429d4156db582. All three old releases
  are drafts. Existing README/packaging contract tests PASS Apple3.9/Python3.11;
  executable audit checks/control flow unchanged after excluding comment/result
  notes. Four changed files pass both scans. Exact tracked ZIP still FAILs on
  the same unchanged one test stub; owner policy/source clearance remains open.
  Existing#7 manifest/RT64/install-guide edits untouched. No hosted workflow,
  new game build, download link, device mutation or publication permission.
- PadMint 0.2.8 is published (Latest, #65): #63 preserves tracked, staged, untracked and
  ignored dependency edits during interrupted-download recovery; #64 clarifies
  phone file selection, rejects disc IDs with an actionable menu message and
  confirms the chosen filename. Both fixes are included in the public packages.
  All 190 source tests pass on Apple's Python 3.9. Packaged Mac and Linux checks
  pass the 14 guided-start and 14 recovery tests; all downloads pass both content
  checks. The Windows VM was suspended after discovering Chris's request in the
  BlueWake chat to keep Parallels off for Mac responsiveness. Merged #65 adds a
  hosted Windows check using the included Python and actual public packages;
  this avoids the local VM. Final hosted run 36789511048 passed all 28 player-flow
  tests using the included Python. Its Windows/Mac/Linux ZIPs are byte-identical
  to the staged packages after preserving checkout line endings. Anonymous public
  downloads match SHA256SUMS; tag points to f0efbb738cac934559e986143343dc8720a6fb1d.
- KartPad #371 merged: device choice means where the player will play; phone-only
  setup needs about 25 GB free. The guide explains file-menu numbers versus RMCP01.
- AnnePad 0.2.2 build 7 rebuilt after two interruptions. Draft #14, recipe/checksums
  pass both content checks. In-place iPhone install preserved every backed-up
  file; attract sequence runs. The blocked test runner was the iPhone's explicit
  Enable UI Automation passcode approval. Chris approved it; the userspace device
  driver now starts and passes without capturing the Mac keyboard. Interactive
  battle acceptance remains open; test-runner success is not gameplay acceptance.
- Published PadMint 0.2.7 made AgePad 0.1.0's personal IPA in 45 seconds. HarkinianPad,
  BarrelPad and BellPad also built through that package. HarkinianPad took 2519 s,
  including a stalled Xcode child cleared without restarting shared services;
  BarrelPad took 15 s and BellPad 20 s with warm caches. These are build checks,
  not new device-play acceptance. Published 0.2.8 has since built BrawlerPad (60 s),
  BallPad (350 s), MaskPad (50 s), PaperPad (100 s), SpaghettiPad (125 s) and GoldenPad
  (325 s), BearBirdPad (681 s), DinoPad (70 s), AnnePad (2427 s) and SunPad
  (55 s), with warm caches. MeleePad 0.2.1 completed in 2027 s through 0.2.8.
  Warm 0.2.8 reruns also passed: HarkinianPad (85 s), BarrelPad (15 s), BellPad
  (15 s), BlueWake (50 s including runner overhead). Sixteen public-recipe builds
  pass independent IPA-byte/record/version/build/minimal-structure readback.
  BananaPad's previous input path was missing; the owner's existing V64 copy
  matches the supported normalized SHA1. Public BananaPad 0.2.1/build 5 now passes
  in 1486 s; independent IPA-byte/record/version/build readback also passes.
- AgePad's public 0.1.0 rerun through 0.2.8 stopped after 5 s after Steam's beta
  client updated between the successful and failed runs. Six Steam files differ;
  the error displays only five. The source, embedded profile and relevant runner/
  injection functions are unchanged; all 651 guarded game files still match.
  The changed Steam client contains new executable code, so replacing fingerprints
  alone is unsafe. A separate exact-version compatibility profile is a proposal
  for Chris, requiring private boundary/injection and compatible-iPad checks.
  Earlier 0.2.7 success is historical, not current readiness. No guard relaxation,
  installed-Steam downgrade, personal output upload or new device acceptance claim.
- AgePad#10 stages a small diagnostic/docs fix atdb3061a: missing-file/version
  errors report how many distinct names were omitted after the first five, and
  the README warns that the updated Steam beta client was rejected. Main17
  portable tests PASS; independent8 synthetic cases PASS on Apple3.9/Python3.11.
  AST/exact-source reconstruction confirms unchanged guards/packaging logic;
  source safety and both exact tracked-root ZIP scans PASS. The full headless
  native/compile/parser suite passes with Simulator execution and real release
  round trip explicitly skipped. Exact-head hosted36817610293 passes safety,
  repository/manifest checks and the same headless game-side suite.
  Public0.1.0 profile/assets and primary checkout unchanged; this is not a new
  compatible profile, device result, account-safety assurance or release.
- StarshipPad v0.2.0 fails through 0.2.8: cached Mac-SDK framework paths leak into
  the iOS compile. Draft starshippad#20 fixes SDK selection/cache invalidation;
  local app and device/simulator SDK probes pass. Exact packaged 0.2.8 generic
  candidate build passed in 131.88 s at 731adde with one job, and hosted full
  unsigned iPhoneOS CI passed. Main independently replayed both SDK probes.
  Draft starshippad#21 stages source-only 0.2.1/build 7; its exact packaged 0.2.8
  build passed in 144.25 s and full hosted app check passed. Main independently
  read back the version, build record, IPA hash and public-source gates. Its
  personal IPA fails the public-content gate as expected and must remain private.
  The release pause still requires owner clearance. Main alone cannot repair release-pinned player builds;
  any successor must retain source-only publication and the private release gates.
- Public entrypoint audit: all 19 buildable catalog games have current PadMint
  release recipes. Current README/release branding has no obsolete PadForge wording
  except deliberate KartPad migration help. Historical release tags may still use
  padforge.json; PadMint deliberately supports that filename. Checksums/parser/tag
  comparisons are checked separately from actual compilation and device play.
- All 18 offered non-Kart recipes pass anonymous download, SHA256SUMS, released
  parser and release-tag recipe comparisons (legacy filename fallback included).
  Three see-repo catalog entries are not offered as player builds.
- PadMint #68 merged after hosted checks: remove Play Protect bypass advice,
  leave Google Play explicitly unvalidated rather than call it too old. Corrected
  the existing kartpad#366 comment too; no device security settings changed.
- Draft PadMint #70 fixes direct make bypassing the unsupported-host check before
  source/tools/app downloads, and pins recipe/source/app to one release snapshot.
  Main independently reviewed the change and passed all 202 tests on Apple's
  Python 3.9. At d61168d, hosted x64 Windows and Linux each pass 40 extracted-package
  checks, including all twelve new host-preflight/release-snapshot regressions.
  Main independently passed the same 40 checks from that run's Mac ZIP and the
  real Mac launcher version command. Imports, ZIP hashes and both content gates
  pass. These checks test player flows, not every backend on each host.
  It is not in public 0.2.8; no new release or supported platform is claimed.
  Explicit-ref candidates retain their selected source, rechecked before tools.
- Draft PadMint #72 at cfdebe3 fixes Windows-generated checksum manifests using
  explicit UTF-8 bytes. The earlier CRLF text confused Unix checksum readers;
  normalization confirmed the package bytes were already correct. The candidate
  passes 192 source cases on Python 3.11 and Apple 3.9, and hosted Windows checks
  all three hashes, LF-only bytes and the unchanged 28-case player-flow suite.
  Main independently reviewed the three-file diff, replayed four focused tests
  and verified the unchanged downloaded manifest on Mac without normalization.
  This is separate from #70, with no version, payload or published asset change.
- Prerequisite inventory matched 17 non-Kart/non-Melee recipes to the published
  hashes. Starship, Mask, Spaghetti and Hark require local CMake, Ninja, pkgconf
  and full Xcode but do not mark them for the player checker. Bounded recipe
  annotation drafts are staged: Starship#22, Mask#14, Spaghetti#25, Hark#35.
  Each retains xcodebuild and adds an iPhoneOS SDK probe with xcrun. Main replayed
  44 player-doctor and 12 make-guard scenarios through the actual 0.2.8 checker,
  plus exact-source gates. Latest-head hosted checks were skipped, not passed;
  current published recipes are unchanged. No new downloader or host support. Backend
  host libraries remain a separate requirement, not satisfied by device-library
  downloads. Melee still requires preinstalled Rust 1.88.0/iOS target through its
  Slippi preparation. A Rust-free offline module path is a proposal for Chris,
  not implemented. Melee#39 stages SDK/IPA guards; main independently passed all
  fourteen released-checker tests including read-only personal IPA validation.
  Hosted source checks and full iOS compilation pass at e1c0e55.
  Sun#53 enables the existing IPA check (formerly none) and Xcode/SDK preflight:
  complete local source suite, eight focused tests and both source/recipe gates
  pass; hosted source suite and full iOS/tvOS compilation passed at 000ec1e.
  These are drafts, not new public downloads. AgePad's injection path does not
  require Xcode; no blanket
  iOS-output prerequisite is added.
- Five more bounded recipe drafts are checked: Bell#19 marks ripgrep; Barrel#18
  adds pkg-config; Dino#12 marks external CMake/Ninja and corrects the Apple SDL2
  CMake floor to 3.24; BearBird#23 marks existing Cargo; Banana#17 marks existing
  Rust/GNU cpp/ripgrep and adds jq. Main independently replayed 12 doctor/10 make
  guards for Bell/Barrel, eight Dino tests and 48 doctor/46 make guards for
  BearBird/Banana using released PadMint 0.2.8. Exact recipe invariants and both
  committed-source ZIP gates pass. Of the Bear/Banana cases, 36 test synthetic
  in-memory floors, not new declared minimums. Bear's unconditional Cargo check
  can require Rust even when a warm backend cache could skip decompression.
  Bell hosted source CI passes; Bear CI was explicitly skipped; Barrel, Dino and
  Banana have no hosted workflow. No app/device checks are implied. These eleven
  game recipe/SDK/IPA drafts remain unpublished; current player recipes unchanged.
- Four further recipe-only drafts pass independent released-0.2.8 checks:
  BlueWake#11 (bbea38f) marks full Xcode and adds iPhoneOS SDK; Golden#49
  (4fb580d) additionally checks the simulator SDK required by its current RT64
  build while preserving Metal. Their 21/37 mocked checker cases pass. Paper#16
  (c679944) and Ball#14 (fc94761) mark CMake/Ninja, with actual pinned floors
  3.24/3.25; 28 doctor and 24 make guards pass. Exact recipe invariants and both
  tracked-root ZIP gates pass all four. Hosted Blue repository audit and Paper
  pinned-source/input checks pass; Golden/Ball have no hosted workflow. Paper's
  isolated dependency verification initially failed on uninitialized submodules;
  matching warm-source verification passed, and its hosted fresh source check
  passed separately. No app/compiler/device acceptance is implied. Fifteen game
  recipe/SDK/IPA drafts are now checked, not new public player recipes.
  Blue's active primary and prior release checkout remain untouched; its SDK
  draft uses a retained isolated worktree.
- Anne#15 (6f98b3e) adds only jq/ripgrep player checks and the README install
  command. Main independently passed 14 doctor and 12 make guards on released
  0.2.8, exact manifest/README/file/ZIP invariants, the source-policy subset,
  patch-stack contract and both JSON/tracked-root ZIP gates. No hosted workflow
  exists; the full native source suite and new app/device checks were not run.
  Sixteen game recipe/SDK/IPA drafts are checked, still unpublished. The existing
  alternative-MIPS-linker/default-prefix limitation remains a proposal, not fixed
  by this jq/rg draft.
- Brawler#14 (ecb2da6) marks CMake 3.24/full Xcode and adds the iPhoneOS SDK
  probe; replaces the redundant PATH-only python3.11 check with the current
  backend's selected-interpreter/Pillow probe. Main independently passed all
  78 released-0.2.8 cases, including 13 real shell selection scenarios using only
  generated executable stubs, checkout-doctor retirement and exact resolver/
  whole-manifest contracts. Existing repository safety/syntax, exact committed
  ZIP hash comparison and both JSON/ZIP content gates pass. No hosted workflow,
  actual SDK/Pillow environment, new app build or device acceptance is claimed.
  Its old public 0.2.0 backend is Homebrew-only; this current-main draft must not
  be transplanted into that release. Seventeen game recipe/SDK/IPA drafts are
  independently checked, not new player downloads; published recipes unchanged.
- PadMint #70/#72 local composed candidate996a2f3 contains only the exact reviewed
  host/release-snapshot safeguards and LF checksum fix. Independent patch-ID,
  seven-file union, overlapping-workflow and unchanged-version/lock proofs pass.
  Both full suites pass 204 cases on Apple Python 3.9 and Python 3.11; the actual
  extracted Mac package passes 58 relevant cases on each. Main independently
  replayed all 58 Mac cases in 16.468 s, verified package imports, all three
  hashes and source/package reference gates. The Windows runtime is byte-identical
  to the checked cached CI artifact; no Windows runtime was executed, and the
  official Python download/checksum path was not rerun in the local cache adapter.
  These locally generated packages remain unpublished candidates named 0.2.8,
  not replacements for the public release. Existing draft #70 now includes #72
  via normal fast-forward update at bd2c78f; main independently confirms the
  exact tested tree and preserved #70 ancestry. Hosted run36808902411 passes
  40 extracted-package cases on Windows (52.606 s, bundled Python) and Linux
  (4.348 s, asserted extracted-package import). Fresh hosted packaging reruns
  the official Windows-runtime download/checksum path and raw LF/hash assertions.
  Main independently downloaded all three Windows-built packages: checksums and
  both public/reference gates pass, and each ZIP byte-matches the Mac-tested
  local construction. Draft #72 remains open and unchanged, no extra PR or
  supported-host expansion. No main merge, version or public release occurred.
  This unversioned composition is historical; the versioned stage below supersedes it.
- PadMint 0.2.9 is staged in existing draft #70 at
  03b83c8be3329906b52c4dc3bda5cbeebafb5d95, including reviewed docs #71 at 6f8d2f9.
  All 204 source cases pass on Apple Python 3.9; main independently passes the
  full 204-case suite on Python 3.11 (33.733 s). The actual extracted Mac package
  passes 58 player cases; main independently replayed them (17.173 s). Exact-head
  hosted run36809913948 passes 40 Windows bundled-Python cases (69.548 s) and
  40 Linux extracted-package cases (5.434 s). Main independently downloaded all
  three versioned packages and verified checksums, exact owned payload/launcher
  bytes and both content scans. The hosted Mac ZIP equals the locally tested ZIP.
  Public Latest remains 0.2.8; publication choice is pending with Chris. No main
  merge, tag, release or new platform claim. These are builder-package tests,
  not every game backend, fresh-host setup, gameplay or legal acceptance.
- Priority-four host-library audit is complete. The original public Hark/Mask/
  Spaghetti/Starship recipes return Ready with zero executable probes and an
  empty system-library list; main independently reproduced the coverage gap with
  SHA-verified recipes and guarded execution. Their native Mac tool/archive
  phase needs external development libraries; iOS downloads do not satisfy it.
  The existing prerequisite drafts now carry checked library setup notes:
  Hark#35 at298f3de, Mask#14 at424b6d9, Star#22 at57ced90 and Spaghetti#25
  initially340ca03. Their already-correct CMake floors (3.26/3.24) were retained,
  not newly introduced. Main independently passed 224 program/doctor/make cases
  plus earlier 44 doctor/12 make guards, exact source snapshots and both JSON/ZIP
  gates. All four hosted repository-safety checks pass. Exact-head hosted full
  unsigned iPhoneOS app/package-audit jobs pass for Hark298f3de (36812269945),
  Mask424b6d9 (36812273544) and Star57ced90 (36812285661). Mask's ROM-free
  Simulator UI job also completed successfully; its overall workflow now passes.
  This is not physical-device/gameplay proof. CI installs host libraries explicitly;
  this is not generic player-host provisioning or fresh-host PadMint proof.
  Spaghetti#25 now071e091 additionally marks its existing required ripgrep for
  player checks. Main passed 18 released-PadMint-0.2.8 program/doctor/make cases,
  exact one-flag/whole-manifest/committed-root ZIP proof, repository safety and
  both JSON/ZIP gates. Exact-head hosted36812944634 passes repository safety and
  its full unsigned iPhoneOS app job, including palm-tree identity, mod selection/
  catalog and package/signing rejection checks. Its existing CI artifact digest,
  IPA checksum, actual 0.2.0/build 7/arm64 metadata, unsigned audit and signed-only
  rejection pass independent verification and main's full scratch replay.
  IPA SHA256 fa31ee216f54c2c21517d171a34bd4a265a37044f1f95233b3062b3412406e9f.
  The public-content gate correctly fails 778 game-code symbols; keep it private.
  No embedded build-provenance record exists; CI checkout/pin evidence is separate.
  Public recipes/releases and backend code are unchanged.
  Complete library discovery or provisioning remains a
  proposal for Chris; no library hard gate, automatic installation, schema or
  backend change is implemented. Warm-cache Mac success is not fresh-host proof.
  One private warm HarkinianPad build through the actual staged 0.2.9 Mac package
  completed once in 313.1 s, four jobs, exit 0. Public v0.2.0/build 7 source
  89e633a and the original recipe remain unchanged; all 35 package files match
  the checked Mac ZIP. Main independently replayed actual IPA/record/hash/version/
  minimal-structure and separate embedded provenance assertions. IPA SHA256
  9f1b80f71d0aaee064195f9a6e51f86ecd831741ab3a1dbc04a7de1adaa551ba.
  The unsigned private IPA correctly fails the public gate on 1,821 game-code
  symbols. Warm imgui/stormlib dependency edits are recorded and preserved.
  This is public-backend warm compile/package proof, not the #35 source-head
  build, fresh-host setup, signing, device play or rights acceptance. No output
  upload; staged 0.2.9 remains unpublished.
- Fresh public entrypoint/recipe audit: all 19 offered release recipes (18
  non-Kart) pass checksum/parser/tag comparisons, with exact required app asset
  filenames and checksum entries present. Published versions/hashes match the
  earlier snapshot. Current player README/release branding has only deliberate
  Kart migration wording; historical padforge.json filenames remain supported.
  Separately, a fresh anonymous download of all six required public base apps
  across five recipes matches exact SHA256SUMS and passes both content gates.
  These are empty/base downloads, not personal game-bearing outputs; the scans
  remain heuristic checks, not rights or gameplay acceptance.
  The README draft explicitly names the current Starship SDK and Age Steam-profile
  blockers; 190 Apple Python source tests and hosted Windows package checks pass.
- Notion's overview now distinguishes published releases from outstanding build
  and device checks. AgePad's current README and own-code MIT license were verified.
- GitHub triage reviewed older open build reports as well as recent comments.
  KartPad #104 (S24 graphics), #357 (S26 Automatic) and #366 (phone storage) remain
  actionable. #366's first-build timing corrected. Draft #369's diagnostic modes
  were checked on the emulator; affected Adreno hardware is still needed. These
  app-specific follow-ups are handed off, not owned by this loop after the scope update.
- The wider sweep covered 61 repositories and 82 open issues. Replied to new
  KartPad #370 (M2 iPad black screen), corrected #332's obsolete setup advice,
  and edited #192 to remove the request for a private diagnostic archive.
  Existing #301 logs did not establish the idle-freeze cause. #304's published APK
  lacks the earlier promised PowerVR correction; bounded staging is preserved for
  the KartPad agent, with no claimed handset fix or public release.
- New Discord report: PWR Jaypp says flickering persists in 0.7.3 in both Original
  and Retro Rewind. His linked GitHub #327 reply now specifies iPhone 16 and only
  game startup; ongoing play is reported flawless. That report, #301's failed
  model-fix reply and #370's iPadOS 18.7.8 black-screen detail belong to the KartPad
  app agent. No new PadMint failure appeared in those comments; no repeated asks.
- Latest #304 response separates a new Termux missing-header build report from
  PowerVR startup. The KartPad agent merged source repair#374 at4c67f07 and owns
  its tests/future recipe integration; public0.7.3 remains pinned to older source.
  No duplicate implementation or reporter request from this loop.

Local continuation handles and evidence: `.codex/scratch/pm028/current-builds-results.jsonl`,

## Loop 2: formula, KartPad 0.6.0, then every repo (started 29 Sep 09:05)

Plan and owner decisions: Notion "PadMint release formula and pilot plan".

- **Step 1 done (09:20).** Windows 11 VM at 16 GB / 8 cores, commands run
  inside it; Docker Desktop runs Linux containers (image pulls work).
- **Step 2 done (09:55).** #336 merged (`87467f3`); main's GitHub source
  archive passes the content check. iOS (11m44s) and Mac (10m42s) builds
  complete through PadMint at 0.6.0/240. CI `boundaries` has failed on main
  since 26 Sep (unrelated pipeline-budget probe). Details:
  KartPad #336 now passes the content check:
  REL guard fixture built from the guard's own anchors; synthetic g6/g7
  translator fixtures generated in tests and checked by SHA-256; translated-build
  log and candidate record moved to private scratch; translator pinned as fork
  branch `kartpad-translator` (same tree). One version file, `version.json`
  (0.6.0 / build 240), read by Android, Mac, the iOS builder and PadMint's
  build record. Verification builds (iOS, Mac) running.
- **Step 3 design notes.** Translated code self-registers through static
  registrars, so a separately loaded game library can register itself if the
  runtime exports its API. Game-derived pieces: shards, registration and
  dispatch tables, `data_sections_init` + blobs, guest symbol table and
  `RuntimeConfig.h` (SDA bases). Next: link the runtime without them to list
  the exact interface.
- **Step 3 progress (10:20).** Android emulator probe proved a library in app
  storage can load and bind to one in the APK (S3). Runtime fork branch
  `codex/game-pack` (android): `MKW_GAME_PACK=APP` builds the runtime without
  game code, a small loader (`src/game_pack.cpp`) loads the pack named by
  `KARTPAD_GAME_PACK`, checks its version and supplies data-init and the SDA
  bases; eight HLE calls into specific translated functions resolve through the
  registry. Standalone `runtime/game_pack` project builds the pack with only
  the NDK. KartPad: launcher "Add your game pack" step, `scripts/build-android-app.sh`,
  `scripts/build-game-pack.sh`, shared `translated-definitions.txt`. First
  empty APK builds (47.6 MB) but the content check FAILS it: (1) Dolphin's
  Android disc-import library carries both Wii common keys (previous public
  APKs likely did too); (2) 559 exported `func_*` HLE override names. Fixes in
  progress: export list without `func_*`; Android disc import rebuilt coreless
  with the player's own key file, like iOS (#335).
- **Step 3, Android done (11:10).** Both content-check failures fixed: Android
  disc import asks once for the player's own `common-key.bin` (an extracted
  folder needs no key); the empty APK exports 0 `func_*` names and passes the
  gate. Empty 0.6.0 APK + pack chosen in the app's Choose File screen reached an
  active race (Luigi Circuit, lap 1/3, 60 FPS, API 36 emulator on the Mac GPU),
  existing licence and save intact. Fixes found on the way, now D6 rules: header
  state lives once in the app (`MKW_GAME_PACK_MODULE`, checked by KartPad's
  `scripts/check-game-pack-state.py` in every pack build); the pack hands the
  app its 8 wrapped original functions (pack interface v2); one pack per app
  version. Pack build ~5 min at 8 jobs on this Mac. Next: iPhone half (empty IPA
  + pack in `Frameworks/`), then Windows/Linux hosts (step 4).
- **Step 3, iPhone half (11:45).** Empty 0.6.0 IPA passes the content check
  (0 address-named functions) and installs in place on the iPhone 14 with data
  intact; the iPhone pack builds and passes the state check. The iPhone race
  waits on iPhone Mirroring, which needs the phone locked once by hand.
- **Step 4 (12:45 to 15:00).** `padmint tools` (pinned, digest-checked
  Git, .NET 8, CMake, Ninja, NDK, nodtool), `padmint get` and
  `padmint make GAME PLATFORM --disc FILE`. KartPad's pack build is now
  pure Python (no bash, perl, rsync). Windows fixes: Git by full path,
  forward-slash paths, nodtool.EXE version text, blob symbol spellings, paths
  under 260 characters, llvm-cxxfilt instead of c++filt.
- **Android gate PASS (15:00).** A clean `padmint make kartpad android` in
  the Windows 11 VM made a pack (SHA-256 `c248cb3c...30c3`) that the
  release-signed empty APK imported and raced with (Luigi Circuit, lap 1/3).
  Windows timing on this ARM VM: tools ~2 min, extract + translate ~3 min,
  compile ~45 min under x64 emulation. Same Release code as the Mac pack
  (116.4 vs 116.6 MB). App fix found on the way (KartPad `b6348e92`): a
  failed import, e.g. a full device, now shows a dialog instead of vanishing.
  Next: rebuild the release APK from `b6348e92`, Linux run in Docker,
  iPhone race, then publish.
- **Linux gate PASS, releases staged (17:00).** Clean Ubuntu x86_64: `padforge
  make kartpad android` 21 min end to end; its pack raced in the final APK.
  Fixes found: Git hint, .NET invariant globalization, NDK symlinks, published
  app name. Mac: `padmint make kartpad ios` from a fresh home, 9 min; the IPA
  boots on the iPhone 14 with saves intact. Players get three ZIPs with a
  launcher and a guided start (D8); Windows and Linux downloads checked. KartPad
  v0.6.0 and PadMint v0.1.0 staged and gate-checked. Waiting on the iPhone
  race (the phone must be locked once, or the UI Automation passcode entered).
- **Published (17:40).** iPhone gate PASS (PadMint-made IPA raced on the
  iPhone 14); KartPad v0.6.0 and PadMint v0.1.0 released and verified by
  anonymous download; pinned KartPad issue #338.
- **Step 7 to 9 (18:30).** D9: iPhone builds target iOS 15 (Xcode 27).
  PadMint: games whose file is added in the app need no `--disc`.
  - BlueWake: formula PR #4 (empty IPA via `build.sh --app-only`; the module
    via `--app`); `padmint make bluewake ios` compiling the module.
  - SunPad: formula PR #50 (app-only build, module added to the published
    IPA, "no game code yet" message); build after BlueWake.
  - HarkinianPad: #30 and #31 merged (0.2.0, recipe only); play-test next.
  - Recipe-only PRs: MaskPad #10, SpaghettiPad #20, StarshipPad #16,
    BallPad #9, BellPad #17, BrawlerPad #9 (fix: the recipe built an app
    that cannot run on a device).
  - Open engines released: DevilTouch v1.5.5-preview.1, VaultPad
    v0.1.0-preview.1 (all assets pass the content check).
  - PaperBoat #1 and PaperPad #11 merged (Torch URL); BananaPad, SnapPad and
    DinoPad still pin an older PaperPad.
  - Owner calls: N64 split vs recipe-only, HarkinianPad #28, SnapPad,
    GalaxyPad and F0X gate policy, UTP, KidPad listing, AltStore #5, CTRPad
    Actions billing.
- **Status (20:10).** Done means three things per repo: a public release in
  the formula's shape, a README "Get it" section that matches it, and the
  Notion row linking both (new tracker columns: Release, README ready).
  - KartPad on a real Android phone: the public PadMint v0.1.0 made the pack
    on this Mac (19 min); added through Choose file on a Pixel 9 Pro XL, it
    raced at 60 FPS. Gap for 0.6.1: no button to replace an added pack.
  - BlueWake: `padmint make bluewake ios` PASS (2 h 19 min including
    tuning; 412 MB module). Installed in place on the iPhone; the console
    shows the module loading, disc reads and 30 FPS at full speed. The
    gameplay screenshot waits for the iPhone's screen to be woken.
  - Merged: StarshipPad #16, BallPad #9, BrawlerPad #9, DevilTouch #8
    (README points to the release). MaskPad #10: release check reads
    version.json. VaultPad #8 (README) waits for CI.
  - HarkinianPad: `padmint make harkinianpad ios --ref main` building; then
    iPhone gameplay and the recipe-only v0.2.0 release. Then a PadMint build
    check and release for BellPad, SpaghettiPad, StarshipPad, BallPad,
    BrawlerPad and MaskPad.
- **Status (21:50).** The iPhone was dark because iPhone Mirroring was still
  attached (closed at 20:28); it is now locked and needs the owner's unlock
  before any gameplay screenshot. Until then:
  - Built through PadMint and installed in place (saves kept): HarkinianPad
    0.2.0 (main; loads oot.o2r, opening scene), GoldenPad 0.2.0 (#40 branch).
  - Built through PadMint from main, recipe-only release staged (content
    check PASS): HarkinianPad, BellPad, SpaghettiPad, StarshipPad, BallPad
    1.1.0. BrawlerPad and MaskPad building. `recipe-release.sh` stages each
    release the same way (recipe from the built commit, version.json check,
    SHA256SUMS, audit, notes).
  - D10 (N64 ports publish the recipe only). Release PRs in the same shape:
    GoldenPad #40, BearBirdPad #16, BananaPad #10, AnnePad #7, DinoPad #7,
    BarrelPad #15 (also fixes the build under stock bash 3.2). Build checks
    queued after MaskPad.
  - PadMint main: guided start handles games whose manifest lives in their
    repository and takes a per-game help link (64 tests). A v0.1.1 release
    with `player_targets` for each released game follows the first recipe
    releases (v0.1.0 offers only KartPad and asks every game for a disc).
  - Merged: MaskPad #10, VaultPad #8 (README).
- **Status (00:00, 30 Sep).** Released after a PadMint build and iPhone 14
  gameplay with the owner's data: BlueWake 0.1.0 (empty app + module),
  HarkinianPad, MaskPad, SpaghettiPad, StarshipPad, BallPad 1.1.0, BrawlerPad,
  BellPad, GoldenPad, BearBirdPad, AnnePad, BarrelPad (recipe only). All twelve
  are in the catalog's guided start. v0.1.1 is the other chat's Windows hotfix;
  main is 0.1.2 (player hardening, PR #5). Before publishing 0.1.2: Windows
  gate with the bundled Python (KartPad build in the VM, C:\\pffix-full.log)
  and a Mac run through PadMint.command (Apple's Python).
  - BananaPad #10: fresh clones failed verify-sources (submodule fingerprint
    included git describe text); fixed, rebuilding. DinoPad #7: catalogued;
    build next. Then SunPad #50 and MeleePad.
- **Status (02:15, 30 Sep).** Released since 00:00: PadMint 0.1.2 (Windows
  and Mac builds passed; Linux: the container starts) and BananaPad 0.2.0. Every released repo was
  re-checked on GitHub: the release has the formula's assets, the README points
  to PadMint, and the Notion row has Release, README ready and L5 set; stale
  "Next action" text on those rows was rewritten.
  - DinoPad #7 builds through PadMint (0.2.0 build 4) and is installed in
    place on the iPhone (ROM and save kept). Gameplay check waits for the
    phone: XCTest shows an "Enable UI Automation" passcode prompt.
  - SunPad #50: the empty app failed the content check (Wii retail and Korean
    common keys from Dolphin's IOSC defaults; two license test ZIPs). Fixed
    with D11 (RecompCore `da96175`, ModernGekko `8f49c55` on
    `codex/sunpad-apple`), notices skip archives, and build-ios-app.sh now
    merges the fresh core (it linked a stale `libSunPadCore.a`). The empty
    IPA passes; a fresh-home PadMint build from the branch is running.
  - MeleePad #35: same fix cherry-picked (RecompCore `3f2a51f`, ModernGekko
    `9be2c5b` on `codex/meleepad-slippi-preview5`); empty-app build next.
- **Status (04:00, 30 Sep).** Four more ports build end to end through
  PadMint from fresh homes and run on the iPhone 14 (installed in place,
  saves kept); each release is staged with the content check passing, and each
  PR names its one remaining step: controlled gameplay on the phone, which
  waits for the phone's UI automation to be re-enabled with the passcode.
  - SunPad #50: title screen reached. Also moved the iOS module build into the
    checkout (a shared /tmp CMake cache broke a second checkout).
  - MeleePad #35: launcher; disc import pending. Fixes: Slippi link inputs
    built before provisioning, `-DHAVE_PIPE2=OFF` (macOS 27 SDK), rustup listed.
  - PaperPad #12 (new recipe: version.json, build-ios-device.sh, padforge.json,
    README Get PaperPad): 12.8 min build, opening scene plays.
  - DinoPad #7: launcher, ROM and save kept.
  - Catalog entries for MeleePad and PaperPad: PR #10 (draft until released).
  - Phone: CoreDevice file copies from the phone stall (AFC works); XCTest hangs
    or asks for the passcode. Installs, launches and screenshots work.
- **Status (04:30, 30 Sep).** PadMint 0.1.3 published: BananaPad in the
  guided start (it was released but not offered), and the gate reads gzip,
  bzip2, xz and tar contents (#11), which let PeonPad #8 merge. Checked on Mac,
  Windows 11 VM (bundled Python) and Linux (Python 3.9); anonymous downloads
  match SHA256SUMS. SunPad and MeleePad staged empty IPAs rebuilt from fresh
  clones; the phone copies use them. EctoPad's one blocker recorded: no build
  from a fresh clone yet.

## Morning handoff (30 Sep, written 04:25)

**Update 08:15:** the phone recovered after restarting its `dtfileserviced`
and `testmanagerd` from the Mac (`devicectl device process signal`). Played on
the iPhone 14 and released: SunPad, MeleePad, PaperPad, DinoPad (0.2.0 each);
DevilTouch's published app reached Tristram (L5). PadMint 0.1.4 offers all 18
games. VaultPad (iPad-only) and the owner decisions below remain.

**Update 09:20:** player path verified end to end: the published PadMint 0.1.4
from an empty home downloaded the published SunPad 0.2.0 app and recipe and
built a personal IPA in 47.6 min; it boots on the iPhone with the save kept.
PadMint 0.1.5 published with the PadMint-experience chat's #13-#16, a quieter
end-of-build message and safe output names. VaultPad #6 merged after a
fresh-home build. KartPad #343 (game_ids for #14's check) waits for the next
KartPad release.

**Re-audit 10:30:** all 41 public release downloads account-wide pass the
content check; every tracker release link resolves. Fixed: PaperPad 0.2.0's
recipe built PaperPad Original, not the PaperBoat app its README describes, so
PaperPad 0.2.1 builds PaperBoat (played on the iPhone); six READMEs still said
"a new version is in progress" (fixed or merging); GalaxyPad #15 merged.
`catalog/paperpad.json`'s note still names build-ios-device.sh (cosmetic).

**Update 12:10:** PadMint 0.1.6 (Windows long paths), 0.1.7 (Android packs on
ARM Linux, raced in the emulator) and 0.1.8 published. 0.1.8 carries the
PadMint-experience chat's #22 (`PADFORGE_CACHE`, one download cache for
every game version) and #23 (a backend's game data folder saved once for the
player), and `padmint list` now shows player targets instead of the
built-in fallback manifests. Each checked on Mac, Linux (Docker) and the
Windows 11 VM; anonymous downloads match SHA256SUMS. KartPad #343-#348 merged;
KartPad 0.6.1 (kartpad#349) is being built and gated. kartpad#347 (packs that
survive app updates) approved with notes for 0.7.0. OpenMobileTTS
v3.1.0-preview.2 published. The PaperPad catalog note now names PaperBoat's
scripts.

**Update 13:50:** KartPad 0.6.1 published (Latest): Replace Game Pack, the
shared Retro Rewind download and the PadMint game data folder. Gates with the
public PadMint 0.1.8 from fresh homes: iPhone 14 race (Mac IPA, 12 min);
emulator update from 0.6.0 raced with the Mac pack (6 min, Retro Rewind from
the cache), then with Replace Game Pack, then with the Windows 11 VM pack
(about 60 min, Defender slows the ARM VM); a new emulator install imported
"KartPad game data" with no key and raced. Pinned #338 is version-free now.
Open: padforge#25 asked us to rename the project (done in PadMint 0.2.0); kartpad#350
(ABI 3 packs, 0.7.0), #351 (stale tests) and #352 (fresh-install status line)
from the PadMint-experience chat.

**Update 14:45:** KartPad 0.7.0 published (Latest): pack ABI 3, so game packs
survive app updates (kartpad#347/#350, merged via #353). Gates: emulator update
from 0.6.1 (prompt, 0.6.1 pack refused, 0.7.0 pack imported, old file removed,
raced); iPhone 14 race; a version-only test build kept the pack and raced with
no PadMint run, and PadMint reused the pack (Android compile skipped with an
identical file, iPhone IPA in 72 s); a header-change test build refused the
pack. Open: Pixel 9 Pro XL check (not connected); padforge#25 (renamed to PadMint).

**Update 15:45:** Renamed to PadMint (padforge#25; committed there for 7 Oct).
#26 merged (package, `padmint` command, launchers, ~/.padforge moved to
~/.padmint once; padforge.json and PADFORGE_* still accepted); repo renamed
to chrissotraidis/padmint; PadMint 0.2.0 published and checked on Mac (full
KartPad Android build from the published 0.7.0 in 132 s, pack reused),
Windows 11 VM (real old home moved, no downloads) and Linux. The 0.1.x
PadForge releases are drafts now (tags kept). Game repos: 17 rename PRs
merged, MaskPad, MeleePad and SunPad wait on CI; KartPad 0.7.1 carries the
in-app wording and the runtime's pack messages (fingerprints unchanged).

**Android phone, no computer (30 Sep, 21:00; draft, codex/pm-android-phone):**
`launchers/padmint-android.sh` sets up Ubuntu 24.04 in Termux (proot-distro)
and runs PadMint there (host linux-arm64). Experimental, one recorded run: an
API 36 arm64 emulator (8 GB, 8 cores, 32 GB) typed the one line into Termux
0.118.3, built KartPad 0.7.2's pack from mkw.rvz (pack SHA-256
`a30d62ea...f839`) and the published 0.7.2 APK raced with it (Luigi Circuit,
lap 1/3, 59 FPS). Paste to pack: 58 min (setup 4, tools 15, build 37:
compile 25 at 5 jobs). Peak: 4.1 GB in Termux, 2.4 GB still free, no
process kills; about 22 GB of storage including the disc. Fixes found: .NET
needs a heap limit under Android's address space; proot's emulated hard links
break copytree (PadMint's game data copy here; KartPad's export on reruns,
kartpad `codex/android-phone-build`). Not tried on a real phone.

**Update 18:10:** KartPad 0.7.1 and 0.7.2 published; both keep players' game
packs (fingerprints unchanged; in 0.7.2 the new app-only vi_pacing.h lives in
runtime/app_only/ so it is not a pack-interface input). 0.7.2 carries the fixes
promised on 27 Sep (#330 measured on the emulator, #327, #329/#316 Automatic on
Adreno 8xx, #104 with the S24 option). PadMint 0.2.0 reused packs for both
iPhone builds (compile 2-3 s). All published *-padforge.json recipe assets
renamed to *-padmint.json with SHA256SUMS updated and verified; release notes
say PadMint. MeleePad #36 and SunPad #51 merged; MaskPad #12 waits on a UI test
that also fails on MaskPad's main (testControlPressReleaseToggleAndLifecycleCancellation).

**Update 18:45:** MaskPad #12 merged after that UI test passed on re-run
(flaky), so all 20 game repos use padmint.json. Player replies posted on
kartpad #104, #316, #327, #329, #330 and #357. iPhone players without a Mac
(#327) cannot build today; that is the most requested gap.

**Update 21:00:** PadMint 0.2.1 published: #28, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34 (see
release notes). Checked on Mac, Ubuntu 26.04 ARM64 and the Windows 11 VM.
Player builds of KartPad 0.7.2 with 0.2.0 on clean Ubuntu 24.04 (plus
libxml2) and 26.04 (libxml2.so.16 shim) were byte-identical and raced on the
emulator. Seven game repos now declare their real build tools (goldenpad#42
and bearbirdpad#18 use PadMint's LLVM, so they need new releases built with
0.2.1). Parallel work: Android builds on the phone (Carson), iPhone IPAs
without a Mac (Hubble).

**Update 06:30, 1 Oct (0.2.7):** AgePad 0.1.0 published by Chris (30 Sep,
22:41; assets pass the content check, anonymous downloads match). #29 adds
AgePad to the catalog (iPad 8 GB+; PadMint injects the player's own Steam copy
in about 12 s, checked on this Mac from the published release). #61 measured
free space for every game (doctor no longer says 0 GB needed).

**Update 06:05, 1 Oct (0.2.6):** rerun census across every game (player path):
AnnePad 0.2.1 failed on every second run, BallPad on any rerun after
packaging, MeleePad on reruns and after another folder's build (/tmp module
folder), BananaPad after an interrupted download; fixed and released as
AnnePad (0.2.2 pending disk), BallPad 1.1.1, MeleePad 0.2.1, BananaPad 0.2.1.
#59: PadMint finishes a half-downloaded submodule in its own game folders
(only when every difference is a submodule), which covers SunPad and
SpaghettiPad. James's sweep with 0.2.2: 14 of 17 built; BlueWake unproven
(disk watchdog).

**Update 01:45, 1 Oct (0.2.5):** the full build sweep with 0.2.2 (James) found
MaskPad failing from a clean folder: "building for 'iOS', but linking in dylib
... MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib/libz.1.tbd". Cause: PadMint.command runs Apple's
/usr/bin/python3, an xcrun shim that exports SDKROOT=MacOSX.sdk,
CPATH=/usr/local/include and LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib to every build, so
CMake resolved the iPhone build's zlib from the Mac SDK. Earlier MaskPad checks
reused a configured folder. #57 drops the three for ios/tvos targets and says
so in the log; no recipe uses them.

**Update 00:50, 1 Oct (0.2.4):** PadMint 0.2.3 published 1 Oct 00:20 (Latest,
checked on Mac, Linux and the Windows VM). town3r's GoldenPad build next
stopped on Xcode's Metal Toolchain (downloaded separately since Xcode 26).
0.2.4: #55 a version check that exits non-zero counts as missing, and
requirements can carry a label, so a recipe can require the Metal Toolchain
(xcrun metal --version); #54 README: Play Protect "Unsafe app blocked" for
Termux on Android 17 (More details, Install anyway). Metal census (player
path of each latest release): AnnePad, BananaPad, BearBirdPad, DinoPad and
GoldenPad compile RT64's Metal shaders on the Mac; the libultraship games,
KartPad, BlueWake, MeleePad, SunPad, BallPad, BellPad and BarrelPad do not.
Recipes marked (annepad#11, bananapad#14, bearbirdpad#21, dinopad#11,
goldenpad#47); those games get recipe-only releases next.

**Update 00:10, 1 Oct (0.2.3):** PadMint 0.2.2 and KartPad 0.7.3 published
30 Sep (both Latest, anonymous downloads verified; KartPad fingerprints
unchanged, emulator and iPhone 14 in-place updates raced). GoldenPad and
BearBirdPad 0.2.1 published (recipes use PadMint's LLVM). 0.2.3: #50 README
after the release; #51 N64 ROMs and GameCube/Wii discs recognized from their
header (town3r's GoldenEye .z64 on padmint#7 had to be picked from a list of
18); #52 recipes mark programs the player installs ("player": true), checked
before any download (GoldenPad needs Homebrew SDL2 for its shader step; our
Macs had it, town3r's didn't; goldenpad#46 marks cmake, ninja, xdelta3 and
sdl2-config). Open: Pixel 9 Pro XL Termux run (phone locked), full 0.2.2
build sweep of every game (James).

**Update 22:55 (0.2.2):** merged #36 (import button named per platform), #37
(Android phone via Termux, experimental), #38 (failure messages with the fix),
#39 (iPhone packs on Windows and Linux: LLVM, libc++ and Apple open-source
headers pinned; D12), #40 (time left), #41 (doctor reads the release recipe
and checks only the player path), #42 (newer recipe says "get the latest
PadMint"), #43 (player-first README), #44 (game data copy on Windows: no "."
in extended-length paths), #45 (CMake caches left by the .padforge move are
set up again, padmint#7), #46 (unzip-first message, "Reading your file"), #47
(keep awake; QuickEdit off while building), #48 (guided start offers
iPhone/iPad on Windows and Linux for ios_off_mac games: KartPad). Off-Mac
proof: KartPad 0.7.2 iPhone pack built on Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 (13.5 min) and
on the Windows 11 ARM64 VM with native arm64 Python (29 min), fingerprint
35ccf81c both, state check PASS, each raced on the iPhone 14 with the save
byte-identical. KartPad main had drifted to iOS fingerprint ad53234e (a comment
in build-ios-device-game-app.sh); kartpad#365 restored 35ccf81c. KartPad 0.7.3
(kartpad#361, #363) follows this release: its recipe names libcxx.

- **Done** (release + README + tracker): KartPad 0.6.0, BlueWake 0.1.0,
  HarkinianPad, MaskPad, SpaghettiPad, StarshipPad, BallPad 1.1.0, BrawlerPad,
  BellPad, GoldenPad, BearBirdPad, AnnePad, BarrelPad, BananaPad; PadMint 0.1.3.
- **Needs 5 minutes with the iPhone, then publish** (runbook:
  `~/.codex/scratch/release-staging/READY-30sep.md`): SunPad #50 (press Start),
  MeleePad #35 (Import Game Data → On My iPhone → MeleePad → the .iso),
  PaperPad #12 (press Start), DinoPad #7 (Start Dinosaur Planet). Each is the
  PadMint build, installed in place with saves kept; releases are staged and
  pass the content check. Then PadMint PR #10 + 0.1.4 for the guided start.
- **Phone:** XCTest needs "Enable UI Automation" (passcode) and now stalls at
  "waiting for workers to materialize"; CoreDevice file copies from the phone
  stall too (AFC works). Unplugging and replugging the cable, then entering the
  passcode at the prompt, should clear both.
- **Device checks open:** DevilTouch (published IPA plays its intro with your
  MPQ; tap into town); VaultPad is iPad-only.
- **Your decisions:** AltStore #5 and the clean engines (mark Clear), SnapPad #7
  test stub, GalaxyPad #15 anchors (spread across research scripts), F0X and
  HarkinianPad #28 patch context, UTP, CTRPad, KidPad listing. EctoPad needs a
  bootstrap script first.
- **Notes:** the local `~/.codex/release-gate/release_gate.py` that AGENTS
  rules cite is an older copy of PadMint's gate (no compressed-file support).
  KartPad's pinned #338 is closed (still pinned). Phone copies to tidy: Melee ISO
  in MeleePad Documents (for the import), DK64.v64 and Animal Crossing.iso in
  BlueWake Documents, a stray copy in BellPad's Library.
- **Disk (165 GB free):** cleanup candidates, not deleted: scratch
  padforge-mac-home 64 GB, worktrees/kartpad-padforge/build 44 GB,
  bluewake-public-cold 15 GB, kp060-phone 15 GB, padforge-fresh-home 11 GB,
  bluewake-fresh 9.8 GB, pack-e2e-mac 6.6 GB, tonight's padforge-*-home and
  *-fresh-020 folders (about 20 GB together).

## Overnight run 28–29 Sep (complete)

## Morning handoff (06:15)

- **Complete personal builds through PadMint (16 games):** KartPad (iOS and
  Mac), GoldenPad, SunPad, AnnePad, SnapPad, MaskPad, HarkinianPad, DevilTouch,
  BarrelPad, VaultPad, StarshipPad, BrawlerPad, SpaghettiPad, BearBirdPad,
  BellPad, BallPad. The gate rejects every output as personal. On `main`:
  GoldenPad and the six earlier ones; the rest wait on PRs (merge queue below).
- **Not verified:** no device install or gameplay (no L5); no non-Mac host build.
- **Nothing published, nothing deleted.** Moved-aside folders and cleanup
  candidates with sizes are in the Notion morning summary.
- **Next session:** owner decisions below; then device tests; then the PadMint
  follow-ups (job cap, Homebrew leak warning).

## Rules for this run

- Nothing public may contain translated or decompiled game code, keys, disc/ROM
  images or extracted assets. A positive gate result is a stop.
- No releases, tags, uploads, AltStore changes, visibility changes, posts or
  comments. No deleting drafts, forks, repos, branches or history.
- Game repos are changed only in worktrees under `~/.codex/worktrees`. Primary
  checkouts with other agents' uncommitted work are not touched.
- Public game-repo PRs merge only for docs/manifest/wrapper/AGENTS changes whose
  tree passes the gate and the repo's own checks. Everything else stays a PR.
- Public READMEs do not mention PadMint while it is private.
- One heavy build at a time, none while another agent's build runs, `-j8` max.
  No new full build below 50 GB free; stop below 30 GB. Nothing is deleted for space.

## Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| L0 | Contained: affected downloads hidden |
| L1 | Docs accurate, dead release links fixed, gate rule present, source tree passes gate |
| L2 | Validated `padforge.json`; `padmint plan` succeeds |
| L3 | Source stages run through PadMint with verified outputs |
| L4 | Personal build through PadMint; gate rejects output as personal, passes source |
| L5 | Verified on a physical device (owner) |

## Log

- 23:49 Environment: BlueWake cold trained build compiling (other agent, read-only
  for this run); 71 GB free; load ~230. Active agents: BlueWake, YomiBoy.
- 23:55 PadMint PR #1 merged to `main` (`5361f33`); 26 tests pass.
- 00:10 Decisions + feasibility in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (iPhone module links
  without Apple SDK for one real chunk; Android host-neutral is conditional).
  Core on main `70de086`: manifests, catalog, list/doctor/check-manifest/audit,
  keyless gate (byte-identical results to the private gate), automatic gate on
  every personal output.
- 00:15 Owner decision: KartPad v0.1.0 and v0.2.0-preview.1 releases are still
  public and their tag source archives contain both Wii common keys (not acted on).
- 00:20 KartPad draft PR #336: build-it-yourself docs, retired links, common-key
  note, Builder stage events, padforge.json. Source gate FAILS on existing
  fixtures; `tests/fixtures/rel_report/function.cpp` shares all 3 labels and 11
  non-trivial lines with the translated game function (owner review).
- 00:25 `c21c595`: in-app inputs (no --disc), generic IPA check, MaskPad entry.
- 00:30 GoldenPad PR #38 merged (draft padforge.json, all targets planned).
  Sweep of 23 repos; retired-link PRs merged for HarkinianPad #27, SpaghettiPad
  #17, BrawlerPad #6, BearBirdPad #13, VaultPad #3; open for SunPad #49,
  MeleePad #34, AnnePad #7, CTRPad #40, GalaxyPad #15, SnapPad #7 (see Notion).
- 00:35 MaskPad fresh build through PadMint failed at configure on Xcode 27
  (upstream caches a 10.15 deployment target; Xcode 27 minimum iOS is 15.0).
  Fixed on the MaskPad branch; rebuild running.
- 00:45 HarkinianPad fork → patches: three patches against upstream Shipwright,
  libultraship and ZAPDTR reproduce the fork trees exactly; gate PASS.
  Draft PR #28 (decompiled context lines need owner policy).
- 00:47 MaskPad complete build through PadMint: 17m28s, exit 0, 17.7 MB personal
  IPA, gate FAIL on the IPA as expected, source PASS (draft PR #9, L4 on branch).
- 00:50 PadMint: `steps` manifests, per-step env, `padmint ui` (checked live).
- 00:55 L2 merged: StarshipPad #14, BrawlerPad #7, SpaghettiPad #18,
  DevilTouch #5, BellPad #15, BearBirdPad #14, BarrelPad #13, VaultPad #4.
  Manifests on open PRs: AnnePad #7, SnapPad #7, SunPad #49.
- 01:00 KartPad bootstrap verified; StarshipPad complete build running.
- 01:08 StarshipPad complete build through PadMint from main: 13m38s, exit 0,
  6.9 MB IPA, gate FAIL as expected → L4; manifest marked experimental (#15).
- 01:10–01:27 KartPad through PadMint: fixed two Builder bugs on #336
  (interrupted-bootstrap recovery; work-root vs shared download cache), then a
  complete build: 17m25s, exit 0, 64.8 MB IPA, provenance check passed, gate
  FAIL as intended, **no Wii key in the personal IPA** (confirms #335).
- 01:30 KartPad accepts other dumps after verified extraction (ISO and RVZ
  converted from the pinned WBFS pass; Wind Waker ISO refused). On #336.
- 01:30 Xcode 27 finding: iOS deployment target 14.0 fails CMake's
  try-compile. Affects MaskPad (#9) and HarkinianPad (#30, draft); all other
  ports target iOS 15+ (remaining 14.0/13.0/11.0 values are macOS targets).
- 01:33 Build queue (scratch runner): BrawlerPad running; then HarkinianPad
  (#30 branch), SpaghettiPad, BearBirdPad, DevilTouch, BellPad, BarrelPad,
  VaultPad, BallPad, BananaPad, AnnePad (#7), SnapPad (#7), DinoPad (#7).
- 01:40 BrawlerPad complete build from main (9m47s) → L4; manifest experimental.
- 01:54 HarkinianPad complete build on #30 (13m50s) → L4 on branch; from main
  it fails on Xcode 27, so #30 is required.
- 02:00 GoldenPad L2 blocker: pinned GoldenEye64Recomp fork lacks `us.toml` and
  the TLB-free patch; maintainer builds used a local upstream checkout.
- 02:10 `padmint history --repo` added. Clean engines' public IPAs all pass
  the gate.
- 02:14 SpaghettiPad complete build from main (19m55s) → L4; manifest experimental.
- 02:26 BearBirdPad complete build from main with the owner's ROM (11m48s) → L4.
- 02:28 BellPad complete build from main (1m27s) → L4. Its personal IPA *passes*
  the gate: decompilation code has named functions. Recorded as a gate limit.
- 02:28 Early failures fixed and re-queued: DevilTouch (Xcode 27 target; draft
  #6), BarrelPad (manifest used macOS /bin/bash 3.2; #14 merged), VaultPad
  (empty submodule in worktrees; #5 merged).
- 02:33 BallPad complete build from main (5m02s) → L4 (gate PASS, decompilation).
  Manifests marked experimental: BearBirdPad #15, BellPad #16, BallPad #8.
- 02:30 KartPad build-only Mac target added to #336 (queued for a real build).
- 02:37 BananaPad failed: PaperBoat's Torch submodule repo (JeodC/Torch-LH) was
  deleted upstream; pinned commit still in JeodC/Torch. Draft PaperBoat#1
  (URL only). Blocks fresh clones of PaperPad, BananaPad, SnapPad, DinoPad.
- 02:54–03:10 Fresh-build failures, all diagnosed and fixed on PR branches:
  AnnePad release audit list stale since 5 Aug (fix on #7, verified on the
  built core); SnapPad manifest missed host tools (#7); DinoPad manifest ran its
  safety check too early (#7); BarrelPad `clone-refs.sh` breaks under macOS
  bash 3.2 — the only bash on stock macOS (draft #15); VaultPad host build uses
  macOS 10.13, Xcode 27 needs 12.0+ (draft #6). All re-queued.
- Queue chain: DevilTouch (#6) → KartPad Mac target (#336) → AnnePad (#7) →
  SunPad (#49) → BarrelPad (#15), SnapPad (#7), DinoPad (#7) → VaultPad (#6).
- 03:10 DevilTouch complete build on #6 (6m06s) → L4 on branch (gate PASS).
- 03:15 KartPad Mac target stopped on a missing macOS Dawn archive that
  bootstrap never fetched; fixed on #336 (`217aa57`, hash from the lock).
  AnnePad fix commit had landed on a detached HEAD; recovered and pushed
  (`26ccdd2`). AnnePad patches fetched deps in place (rebuild blocker; noted).
  Re-queued after VaultPad: AnnePad, KartPad Mac.
- 03:22 BarrelPad complete build on #15 (45 s) → L4 on branch.
- 03:21 SunPad: dependencies bootstrapped (8m46s), then Dolphin desktop tools
  failed on the macOS 27 SDK (curl pipe2 availability). Fix on #49
  (`-DHAVE_PIPE2=OFF`); MeleePad has the same configure. Re-queued last.
- 03:27 SnapPad: iOS configure fails on Xcode 27 (SDL2 try-compiles cannot find
  AvailabilityMacros.h) — needs investigation. DinoPad manifest rewritten to the
  README order; re-queued before SunPad.
- 03:37 VaultPad complete build on #6 (9m17s) → L4 on branch (gate PASS on the
  personal output; decompilation-style source).
- 03:57 AnnePad on #7: dependencies, ROM preparation, translation and the iOS
  device build all succeeded (20m25s), then packaging stopped on a missing
  macOS host tool (`build-macos/file_to_c`). The manifest now builds the Mac
  host tools first (#7, `7836a74`); re-queued.
- 04:08 KartPad Mac target on #336: compiled, linked, signed and packaged
  `KartPad.app`, then the package audit failed. Cause: the packager still
  stamped 0.4.17/build 39 while the audit expects the public 0.4.22/build 43.
  Packager defaults updated (`cbf6818`); a copy of that app re-stamped to
  0.4.22/43 with its original Bluetooth entitlement passes the full audit.
  Clean rebuild queued last.
- 04:10 Queue: DinoPad (#7) → SunPad (#49) → AnnePad (#7) → KartPad Mac (#336).
- 04:13 DinoPad on #7: through bootstrap, safety check, host tools and base
  translation, then the Mac host configure demanded restored-edition files.
  Manifest now configures the host with restoration off and builds only the
  two host shader tools (both verified to build; `b460bd6`).
- 04:40 **Xcode 27 root cause for SnapPad:** RT64's CMake forces a 10.15
  (macOS) deployment target on every Apple platform; Xcode 27 rejects it for
  iOS, so every configure check under RT64 fails (the AvailabilityMacros.h
  error was a red herring). One-hunk RT64 patch keeps 10.15 for macOS only.
  With it SnapPad's full iOS configure completes (#7, `779583e`). DinoPad had
  the same unguarded line; same patch added (#7, `c065d01`). AnnePad,
  BearBirdPad, BananaPad and GoldenPad already carry an equivalent fix.
- 04:42 KartPad Mac runner had died with its launching shell; folded into a new
  queue: SunPad (running) → AnnePad → KartPad Mac → DinoPad → SnapPad.
- 04:30 EctoPad (never released, source passes): gate rule merged (#4) → L1.
- 04:30 SunPad passed the step that failed before (Dolphin tools on the macOS
  27 SDK); now translating. Its module build runs `ninja -j 16` internally,
  ignoring the PadMint job cap (noted, harmless tonight).
- 04:35 Clean engines: full git history (all refs) passes the gate for KidPad,
  CaesarPad, EmeraldTablet, RAtouch and DaggerPad; PeonPad passes after
  decompressing its upstream .gz/.bz2 fixtures. Scanner positive control:
  KartPad's flagged fixture fails. Gate rule merged for EmeraldTablet (#1) and
  DaggerPad (#5); PeonPad #8 left open (tree fails closed on the compressed
  fixtures). **Not touched:** CaesarPad (CI uploads IPA artifacts on PRs and
  pushes), KidPad (release-public job on push to main), RAtouch (inherited
  workflows run on any push and include a "latest" development-release job).
  Pushing there could publish, so the rule is an owner item.
- 04:37 **GoldenPad correction:** the recorded L2 blocker was wrong — the
  pinned fork (`7c56979`) contains `us.toml` and both TLB-free patch files,
  byte-identical to upstream `a787fe0` (an ancestor). Draft #39 adds
  `scripts/build-personal-ipa.sh` chaining the maintained steps plus a
  byte-order/SHA-1-checked ROM conversion (verified on the owner's V64: exact
  TLB-free hash) and points `padforge.json` at it. Queued for a full build.
- 04:40 Queue runners launched from a tool shell die when the call ends; the
  surviving ones run in their own session. Relaunched that way. Order:
  SunPad (running) → AnnePad → KartPad Mac → GoldenPad (#39) → DinoPad → SnapPad.
- 04:43 SunPad on #49: past the macOS 27 SDK failure, translated and linked the
  game module (29.5 min), then provisioning failed: pkg-config handed the iOS
  core Homebrew's macOS minizip-ng, so the bundled archive was never built.
  Host leak fixed with `-DUSE_SYSTEM_MINIZIP-NG=OFF` (`eb6a17b`; fresh configure
  confirms bundled). Old iOS core folder renamed aside. Re-queued after GoldenPad.
  PadMint lesson: builds should not depend on what Homebrew has installed;
  worth a doctor warning later.
- 05:17 AnnePad on #7 (33m42s): every stage ran through PadMint and AnnePad's
  own app audit passed; the packager then refused because it only writes under
  `artifacts/`. Manifest fixed (`89208c4`: package there, then export). The
  corrected packaging run on that build produced an 84.7 MB personal IPA; gate
  FAIL as intended → **L3** (L4 needs a clean rerun). AnnePad's iOS step runs
  ninja with no job limit (~38 compilers). KartPad Mac build started 05:17.
- 05:28 **KartPad Mac target complete through PadMint** (#336 at `cbf6818`):
  11m05s, exit 0, 168 MB `KartPad.app` passes the repo's own Mac package audit,
  gate FAIL as intended, no Wii key. KartPad now builds iOS and Mac personal
  copies through PadMint. GoldenPad (#39) build started.
- 05:31 **GoldenPad complete personal build through PadMint** (#39 at
  `fd92db5`): 2m45s, exit 0, all 91 objects fresh (63 recompiled-function
  files), primary IPA audit passed, 7.2 MB IPA, gate FAIL as intended. Repo
  checks pass; tree passes the gate. #39 merged (`8617c3d`), manifest
  experimental → **L4 on main** (was L1 blocked). SunPad (#49) build started.
- 05:34 **SunPad complete personal build through PadMint** (#49 at
  `eb6a17b`): exit 0, bundled minizip-ng, module provisioned, SunPad's own iOS
  package audit passed, 26.8 MB IPA, gate FAIL as intended; check-repository
  passes → **L4 on branch** (script fixes, so #49 is the owner's to merge).
  DinoPad (#7) build started.
- 05:34 DinoPad stopped in 10 s: its safety check pins a checksum of the whole
  patch set, which the new RT64 patch changed. Lock and docs updated
  (`6ed8618`); safety check clean. SnapPad stopped in 20 s: its build folder
  had cached the failed checks from the broken Xcode 27 configure (a fresh
  folder configures fine); stale folder renamed aside. Queue: AnnePad clean
  rerun (running) → DinoPad → SnapPad.
- 06:02 **AnnePad complete personal build through PadMint** (#7 at
  `89208c4`): 26m07s, exit 0, all stages including packaging and export,
  84.7 MB IPA, gate FAIL as intended → **L4 on branch**. DinoPad started.
- 06:02 DinoPad reached the iOS compile, then the base-edition preparation
  demanded the restoration dispatch map, which only the DinoMod restoration
  step creates. It is only needed to undo restoration renames; a base-only
  generation has none. Fixed on #7 (`b8f864a`: skip when nothing to undo,
  still refuse renamed code without the map); base preparation verified.
  Re-queued after SnapPad (running).
- 06:10 **SnapPad complete personal build through PadMint** (#7 at
  `779583e`): 7m42s, exit 0, Xcode 27 configure passes with the RT64 patch,
  7.7 MB IPA, gate FAIL as intended. Formal level stays L0 (source-gate test
  stub policy). Finding: SnapPad's packager prints "Public unsigned SnapPad IPA
  audit passed" for this personal IPA — misleading label. DinoPad started.
- 06:18 DinoPad (#7 at `b8f864a`): Xcode 27 configure passes and the base app
  compiles ("unsigned iOS base app ready"), then the device safety audit fails:
  the compiled-dependency (license notice) inventory only defines the restored
  edition's build folder. Adding a base target changes license-notice data, so
  it is left for owner review → **L3**. Queue finished; no runners remain.

## Owner decisions pending

1. **KartPad keys in two still-public releases:** v0.1.0 and v0.2.0-preview.1
   are published; their tag source archives contain both Wii common keys.
   Drafting them is reversible; tags/history stay downloadable either way.
2. **Gate policy for references to game functions** (the gate has no exemptions):
   KartPad guard skeleton + synthetic tests + log/record markers; SnapPad test
   stub; GalaxyPad signature anchors in scripts; F0X and HarkinianPad
   (PR #28) decompiled context lines inside patches.
3. **iOS 15 minimum** (Xcode 27 cannot target iOS 14): MaskPad #9,
   HarkinianPad #30, DevilTouch #6. Each builds completely on its branch.
4. **Runtime-only public apps:** feasible in principle (S1); BlueWake, SunPad
   and MeleePad already separate app and game module. Publishing is your call.
5. **Make PadMint public** (public READMEs cannot point to it until then).
6. **Gate rule for CaesarPad, KidPad and RAtouch:** add AGENTS.md yourself (or
   with `[skip ci]`). Their CI builds/uploads IPAs or can create a "latest"
   release on push, so nothing was pushed overnight. Full history of all six
   clean engines passes; EmeraldTablet and DaggerPad are ready to mark Clear.
7. **PeonPad #8** (gate rule): tree fails closed only on compressed upstream
   fixtures that pass when unpacked. Merge, and decide whether to unpack or
   exclude them.
8. **Torch-LH deleted upstream:** draft PaperBoat#1 (URL only) unblocks fresh
   clones of BananaPad and PaperPad.
9. Existing: delete the 157 drafts; retire forks; history rewrites.

## Follow-ups for PadMint itself

- Several repo scripts ignore the job cap (SunPad's module build `-j16`,
  AnnePad's iOS ninja unlimited). Done 06:30: every backend now gets
  `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` = `--jobs` (test added; 49 pass); scripts
  calling ninja/make/xcodebuild directly still need `{jobs}`.
- Host leaks: Homebrew libraries can be picked up by iOS builds (SunPad's
  minizip-ng). `padmint doctor` could warn about known offenders.
- Detached-HEAD pushes: queue runners detach worktrees; commit on the branch.

## STATUS.md as of 3 October 2026 (replaced 4 October)

## PadMint status

Updated **3 October 2026**. This page summarizes current delivery and open
limits; the [compatibility matrix](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) records individual
release recipes and verified host/output combinations.

### Available and checked

- **PadMint v0.2.9** is public for Windows, macOS and Linux. The catalog contains
  22 projects, including 19 with public player recipes and three direct-preview
  or paused entries.
- The released v0.2.9 packages completed KartPad v0.7.3 Android pack builds on
  **macOS ARM64, Ubuntu ARM64 and Windows 11 ARM64**. All three outputs passed
  architecture, 16 KB alignment, app-interface and exported-file hash checks.
  See [recorded builds](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md#recorded-android-pack-builds) for
  the exact environments and their limits.
- Focused setup fixes have merged across the game repositories: required-tool
  checks, SDK selection, selected build-job limits and package verification.
  Existing release recipes remain pinned to their published source versions.
- PadMint source checks and packaged player-flow CI exercise validation,
  recovery and packaging. These checks complement actual game builds.

### Open work

- Physical Android play with the three newly built outputs remains unchecked.
  Native Windows x64, Linux x64 and Intel Mac acceptance also remains open.
  Android phone-only building is experimental.
- StarshipPad's public v0.2.0 recipe still has the reproduced SDK-selection
  failure. [Source fix #22](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/starshippad/pull/22)
  has merged and passed full CI; an updated public recipe is still needed.
- SunPad's public v0.2.0 app lacks scene startup required for its SDK 27 build
  on iOS/iPadOS 27. [Source fix #55](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/sunpad/pull/55)
  passed full iOS/tvOS compilation and a UIKit lifecycle probe. A verified app
  update, physical iOS 27 acceptance and the new crash reporter's cause remain open.
- Most iOS recipes require Apple Silicon and Xcode. Portable resource tools
  alone do not provide a complete Windows or Linux player route.
- AgePad requires an exact supported Steam installation; an updated client was
  rejected in prior checks. SpaghettiPad's off-Mac module work remains a draft.
- [Issue #75](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/padmint/issues/75) tracks wider
  catalog compatibility. Per-game runtime and device issues remain in their
  respective repositories.

Personal game outputs stay private. Content scans are technical checks;
publication and rights decisions require their own review.

### Earlier evidence
