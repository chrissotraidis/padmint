# PadMint decisions

## D0. The name is PadMint (30 Sep 2026)

This project was first published as PadForge, a name an established Windows
controller remapper had used since February 2026. Renamed to PadMint at its
maintainer's request (padmint#25): repository, command, launchers and release
files. For existing players and game repositories, PadMint moves the old
`~/.padforge` folder once (keeping downloaded tools), still reads a checkout's
`padforge.json`, and also sets the `PADFORGE_*` variables for build steps
until every game repository reads `PADMINT_*`.

Recorded 29 Sep 2026 during the overnight run. Evidence is from this Mac; items
marked *unverified* have not been demonstrated. Scanner results and build
feasibility are technical findings, not copyright or licensing clearance.

## D1. Command line first; the GUI is a thin layer over the same engine

- **Engine:** the Python CLI (`python3 -m padmint`). Python runs on macOS,
  Windows and Linux, needs no packages, and already implements locking,
  progress relay, cancellation and build records.
- **First GUI:** `padmint ui`, a local browser page served by Python's standard
  library on `127.0.0.1`, reading the same `progress.jsonl` events. No Electron,
  Tauri or native toolkit, so there is nothing extra to sign or notarize per OS.
- **Later:** a downloadable one-file bundle (`.dmg`/`.exe`/AppImage) once a
  complete build works through the CLI and players need a no-Python install.
- **Why:** one engine for all three operating systems; the interface cannot
  drift from what the CLI actually does; the expensive part (tool setup and
  multi-hour builds) is the same either way.
- **Implemented 29 Sep:** `python3 -m padmint ui` serves the page on
  `127.0.0.1` with a random token and a Host check, runs `doctor`/`plan` in
  process and starts builds as `python3 -m padmint build` subprocesses (one at
  a time, cancellable), showing stages from the same events. Checked in the
  in-app browser against StarshipPad: current commit, doctor Ready, plan steps.
- **Player window, 3 Oct:** players found the terminal confusing (a Windows
  player reading it through a translator saw only download lines and did not
  know what came next). Double-clicking PadMint now opens the page as a player
  window: game, own game file (the system's Open dialog, files found in
  Downloads, or a typed path), device, then three plain steps, Cancel, Copy
  details and the game's next steps, in English, Spanish or Portuguese. It runs
  `python -m padmint make` as a subprocess, so it can do nothing the terminal
  cannot; it shows no game art or logos. Phones, scripts, a Linux computer
  without a desktop, `padmint start` and `PADMINT_TERMINAL=1` keep the terminal
  questions. The developer form (checkout, commit, plan) is gone; developers use
  `plan` and `build` directly.
- **Phones and apps without a build, 3 Oct:** in Termux, `padmint` opens the same
  page in the phone's browser with Termux's `termux-open-url` (Ubuntu inside
  Termux sees Termux's files and shares its network). The page hides Choose file
  (there is no Open dialog) and lists the game files in Download. Checked on an
  API 36 emulator: page, file check, build start and Cancel. Apps whose published
  app needs no game code (catalog `download`) appear under **No build needed**
  with download and import steps, while their tracker rows allow their existing
  releases; RAtouch (notice review), UTP (draft releases only) and OpenRCT2Touch
  (no iPad download) are not listed.

## D4. Manifests may list existing scripts as ordered steps

A target declares either one `command` (with optional modes/options) or
`steps` (stage name + argument list). PadMint runs steps in order, emits the
stage events itself, rechecks the checkout before each step and stops at the
first failure. Most ports already have working scripts, so adding a game is a
manifest-only change rather than a new wrapper in every repository.

## D2. Games plug in through a manifest they own

- Each game repository owns `padmint.json` (schema in
  [`padmint/manifest.py`](../padmint/manifest.py)): identity, kind, accepted
  inputs, host/target matrix with per-cell status, entry commands, stages,
  output checks and publication policy.
- PadMint's catalog (`catalog/*.json`) pins each supported game to a
  repository URL and a reviewed commit. Adding a game = manifest in its repo +
  one catalog entry. Game-specific translation, patches and packaging stay in
  the game repository; PadMint does not copy them.
- Kinds: `disc-translation` (static recompilation), `emulator-shell`,
  `decomp-patches` (fetch upstream decompilation, apply own patches),
  `upstream-engine` (fetch other projects' engines), `clean-engine`.

## D3. PadMint is the home of the compliance gate

- `padmint audit <path>` runs the release gate (copied from the private
  `~/.codex/release-gate/release_gate.py`, which remains the reference until the
  owner retires it). Every PadMint package step runs it automatically and
  records the result: personal builds must be labeled *personal, not
  publishable*; source archives must pass.
- A gate failure on anything intended for publication is a stop.
- **Limit found 29 Sep:** the gate recognizes translated code by address-named
  symbols, keys, section markers and provenance. Decompilation ports compile
  named functions, so their personal apps can PASS (BellPad: 0 symbols). For
  those ports, `publication.public_binaries: false` in the manifest is the
  safeguard; a gate PASS is never permission to publish a decompilation build.

## D5. One release formula for every game (owner decision, 29 Sep 2026)

Nothing containing game code, disc data or keys is published. Everything else
is, in the same shape for every repo and every update: one version (the repo's
`version.json`), assets named `<Game>-vX.Y.Z-...`, and `SHA256SUMS`.

| Kind | Published | Player uses PadMint to |
|---|---|---|
| No game code (clean engines) | Full APK/IPA | Nothing |
| Translated code (KartPad, BlueWake, SunPad...) | Empty app + recipe | Build the game pack from their own disc |
| Decompilation (HarkinianPad, MaskPad...) | Recipe only | Build the whole app from public source + their ROM |

Why: the translated or decompiled game code is the only part that cannot be
shared; splitting it out keeps everything else a normal download with normal
in-place updates. On Android the empty app keeps the owner's signing key and
loads the pack from its own storage, so updates and saves are unaffected.
Translated ports share three recipes (WiiCompiled, Dolphin/DolRecomp,
N64Recomp+RT64) instead of one per repo. PadMint is one app for every game,
released on its own schedule.

## D6. The player's computer builds only the game pack (29 Sep 2026)

With D5, a player's Windows, Mac or Linux computer never builds the app itself.
For a translated-code game it extracts the disc, translates it, and compiles
one library against the published app's runtime:

- Android: the Android NDK's compiler, CMake and Ninja. No Gradle, Java or
  Android SDK. The player copies the pack to the phone and picks it in the app;
  it loads from the app's own storage.
- iPhone: the pack is a dylib that PadMint puts inside the empty IPA
  (`Frameworks/`); the player's sideloading tool signs the IPA as usual.

Why: it is the smallest toolset that works on all three systems, and the
published app, its signing and its updates stay the owner's.

Rule for every game pack (learned on KartPad): runtime state that lives in
headers (C++ `inline` variables, including `thread_local` ones and statics
inside inline functions) must exist once, in the app. A pack compiled with its
own copies runs, but reads state the app never sets (KartPad's first pack
aborted with "CurrentCpuContext is NULL"). The runtime declares such variables
`extern` when `MKW_GAME_PACK_MODULE` is set, and the app references each one
so it is always exported. Check for regressions by listing data symbols that
both the pack and the app define; the answer must be none (a pure lookup cache
is the only allowed exception).

## D7. PadMint downloads its own pinned tools (29 Sep 2026)

`padmint tools GAME --target TARGET` installs what that target lists (Git on
Windows, .NET 8, CMake, Ninja, the Android NDK, nodtool) into PadMint's own
folder (`~/.padmint/tools`), never system-wide. Every download is pinned in
`padmint/tools.lock.json` with the publisher's own digest (GitHub release
digests, CMake's SHA-256 list, Google's SDK index, Microsoft's release
metadata); `scripts/update-tools-lock.py` regenerates it. Builds get the tools
first on PATH plus `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` and `DOTNET_ROOT`.

Why: a player on a clean Windows PC should not have to find and install six
developer tools by hand, and pinning keeps every player's build identical.
At the time of this decision, Linux game packs built only on x86_64. That
restriction was later removed with the pinned ARM Linux toolchain. Consult the
current README and tools lock for supported host/target combinations; the old
Google NDK availability observation is not a current PadMint host restriction.

.NET runs with invariant globalization (`set` in the lock): the Linux run
stopped because a plain Ubuntu has no libicu, and a system language that writes
decimals with a comma must not change generated code.

## D8. Players get a folder with a launcher, not an installer (29 Sep 2026)

PadMint's release is three ZIP files: Windows (with Python's official
embeddable package, pinned by python.org's SHA-256, so nothing else to
install), macOS and Linux (the system Python). Each holds the same `padmint`
package plus a launcher: `PadMint.cmd`, `PadMint.command`, `padmint.sh`.
Since 0.4.0 the unzipped folder holds only the launcher, `Start here.txt` and
an `app` folder with everything else, so players see what to open.
Starting PadMint with no command asks only what it cannot know: the game (and
the phone type when there is a choice), the player's game file (drag it into
the window) and the folder to save in. `player_targets` in a catalog entry is
what makes a game appear there.

Why: this is D1's "no-Python install" with nothing to sign, notarize or keep in
step per operating system, and it reuses the tested CLI. ZIP everywhere
because the release gate opens ZIP archives only. Unsigned launchers still meet
SmartScreen and Gatekeeper warnings; the README says how to get past them. A
signed desktop app is a later step if players need it.

## D9. iPhone builds target iOS 15 or later (29 Sep 2026)

Xcode 27, the Xcode PadMint's iPhone builds use, supports iOS 15.0 to 27.0
only; a project that asks for 14.0 fails at CMake configure (HarkinianPad and
MaskPad showed it, from their upstreams' cached 10.15 macOS target). Ports that
defaulted to 14.0 move to 15.0, still overridable. iOS 15 runs on the same
iPhones and iPads as iOS 14 (iPhone 6s and SE, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4 and
later), so no device loses support; a device still on 14 needs a system update.

Why: a player's PadMint build must succeed with the current Xcode. Recorded
as a loop decision (not in the owner's stop list); reversible per port with its
`DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` override.

## D10. N64 ports publish the recipe only (29 Sep 2026)

The N64 ports (GoldenPad, BananaPad, BearBirdPad, SnapPad, DinoPad and the
like) compile the code translated from the ROM straight into the app binary
through CMake; they have no separate game module. They therefore follow the
decompilation row of D5: the release publishes the recipe, and PadMint builds
the whole app from the player's own ROM.

Why: splitting each N64 port into an empty app plus a loadable module (the
BlueWake and KartPad pattern) would be new engineering per port, and it gives
the player nothing: these are iPhone/iPad-only apps, so the player needs an
Apple Silicon Mac either way, and nothing with game code is published in either
shape. The N64 recipe (N64Recomp + RT64) stays shared across the ports. If a
port gains Android or a Windows-built iPhone path later, revisit this for it.

## D11. Published Dolphin-based apps carry no Nintendo keys (30 Sep 2026)

Dolphin sets built-in Wii keys (retail, Korean and dev common keys, SD key) as
IOS defaults, so any empty app linking the Dolphin core fails the content check.
The Dolphin-based ports SunPad and MeleePad (BlueWake's published app already
passes) build their iOS core with `PADMINT_PUBLIC_APP`, which leaves those keys zeroed
in `IOSC.cpp` on each port's RecompCore branch. The published app is also the
one PadMint completes for players, so there is one build, not two.

Why: GameCube games never use these keys, and a Wii title would read the
player's own `keys.bin`, the same pattern as KartPad's Android disc import
asking for the player's `common-key.bin`. A compile switch in the fork is one
reviewed change per port; binary patching or a second "public" build would be
new machinery.

## D12. iPhone game packs on Windows and Linux use LLVM and open-source headers (30 Sep 2026)

For a game whose published IPA loads a player-built game pack (KartPad), the
game names `libcxx`: libc++'s headers from LLVM 21.1.8, with downloads for
Windows and Linux (arm64 and x86_64) only. There it brings, as companions,
`llvm` (21.1.8 for those hosts, with `ld64.lld` and `llvm-install-name-tool`
added) and six Apple open-source archives (`apple-libc`, `apple-xnu`,
`apple-libpthread`, `apple-libmalloc`, `apple-libplatform`,
`apple-availability`; APSL 2.0), each unpacked only where the game needs it.
The game assembles its SDK from them (KartPad:
`builder/kartpad_builder/ios_sdk.py`, which records every file's origin and
license). A Mac keeps using Xcode and downloads none of these; its LLVM
entries (for N64 patch code) are unchanged. Naming `libcxx` rather than `llvm`
keeps Macs from downloading LLVM for iPhone builds.

Apple publishes no digest for these archives, so the lock pins the GitHub
archive of each release tag's commit and the SHA-256 that
`scripts/update-tools-lock.py` computes (two downloads matched). Release order:
a game manifest naming `libcxx` is rejected by PadMint releases without it, so
PadMint ships this before the game does.

Why: Apple's SDK may only be used on Apple computers; these parts are
redistributable and are downloaded from their publishers, never re-hosted.
Checked with KartPad 0.7.2 on Linux arm64 and Windows 11 ARM64 (arm64 Python)
through to a race on an iPhone 14.
Also: a changed lock entry now installs again, a download missing a listed
file installs nothing, and tar downloads unpack on Windows.

## S1. iPhone/iPad module without Xcode or Apple's SDK: plausible, partly verified

Update 3 Oct 2026: shared by every game, see D13.

## D13. One iPhone module pipeline for every game (3 Oct 2026)

D12's open-source SDK assembly moves from KartPad's builder into PadMint
(`padmint/ios_module.py`, GPL-3.0-or-later like the KartPad code it came from, same
author). A recipe declares `ios_module`; PadMint prepares the SDK and toolchain,
the game compiles its library, and PadMint checks the library's imports against the
published app and inserts it. The same path runs on Windows, Linux and Apple Silicon
Macs: Macs need no Xcode for it. The open-source archives are identical on every
computer, so their lock entries are marked `any_host` and only `ios_module` recipes
use them on a Mac; existing recipes download exactly what they did before.

Why: Apple's SDK may only be used on Apple computers, so a published app without game
code plus a game library built from open-source parts is the only legally clean way to
make iPhone apps on other computers. One shared implementation replaces per-game copies
(KartPad's, SpaghettiPad's draft), so every game moved onto it inherits fixes. CI runs
`scripts/ios-module-probe.py` on native Windows, Linux and macOS runners.

Update 30 Sep 2026: done for KartPad, see D12.

Test (BlueWake, private scratch, nothing committed): one real translated chunk
(1.47 MB C source) plus all eight runtime/export sources of the game module were
compiled with Homebrew's open-source clang 22 for `arm64-apple-ios17.0` using
`-nostdlibinc` and a 5-file header shim of standard C prototypes written for
the test. Only 11 C-library symbols are needed from the system. `ld64.lld`
linked them against a hand-written 13-symbol `libSystem.tbd` stub into an iOS
Mach-O dylib: platform iOS, min 17.0, only `/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib`
loaded (same as the Xcode-built module), exporting `staticrecomp_get_module`
and `staticrecomp_get_rel_data`. Ad-hoc signing and `codesign --verify --strict`
passed. The chunk took 244 s at -O2 under load ~230.

What this means: BlueWake's iOS app already loads the game from
`Frameworks/gGZLE01_recomp.dylib` at runtime. A runtime-only app (the gate
passes BlueWake's app without that file) plus a module built on the player's
computer with LLVM (available for Windows, Linux and macOS), inserted before
signing with Sideloadly/AltStore/SideStore or `zsign`, would let Windows and
Linux users make iPhone builds without Xcode.

Unverified: a complete 808-unit module linked this way; loading it on a device;
whether the translator (DolRecomp) and training host build on Windows/Linux;
local optimization training off macOS. KartPad does **not** have this split
today: its translated C++ is linked statically into the app
(`add_library(kartpad_g7_translated STATIC)`), so it needs a module refactor
first. Publishing a runtime-only IPA/APK is an owner decision.

Later the same night: SunPad already works this way in development. Its app
loads `gGMSE01_recomp.dylib` from the app container, generated locally by
`scripts/ios-build-core-device.sh` and provisioned separately from the app
(`docs/BUILDING.md`). So two of the static-recompilation ports (BlueWake,
SunPad) already separate the game module from the app. For sideloading, the
module would ship inside the IPA's `Frameworks/` so the signing tool re-signs
it with the app.

MeleePad goes further: its retired Preview 7 shipped an unsigned *module-free*
IPA shell, with the game module generated locally from the player's disc
(`docs/FAQ.md`). The audit recorded that shell as publishable once Dolphin's
common keys are removed. So three ports (BlueWake, SunPad, MeleePad) already
separate the app from the game module, which is the design a runtime-only
public app would need.

## D14. Steps choose their systems; four parts make any game buildable off a Mac (4 Oct 2026)

A recipe step may list the systems it runs on (`"on": ["windows"]`); without `on` it
runs everywhere, so existing recipes are unchanged. Steps for different systems may share
a stage name, and every runnable host must have a step. `steps_here()` picks the steps
in validation, planning and the build.

Why: the game repositories already have the pieces, in different languages per system.
BlueWake translates with `scripts/builder/build.sh` on Macs and Linux and with
`scripts/windows/build.py` on Windows, and both produce the same verified composite
source; the iPhone library build after that is identical on every computer (D13). One
recipe with per-system source steps reuses that work instead of rewriting each game's
scripts in one language or shipping a Unix shell for Windows (MinGit's `sh` lacks
`sha256sum`, `nproc`, `tar` and `patch`, and a shell does not bring the host compiler
the translators need).

The per-game work is then the same four parts, in `docs/ADDING_A_GAME.md`: a published
app with no game code, source steps per system, a library build with `{ios_toolchain}`,
and `ios_module`. Families share them: the GameCube and Wii ports follow BlueWake, the
engine ports SpaghettiPad, and the N64 ports need the app split first (D10).

## S2. Android builds from Linux/Windows: conditional yes

KartPad's Android build reuses the same translation output as iOS and uses
cross-platform tools (Gradle, NDK, CMake, .NET 8 translator, Python). It is
deliberately locked to Apple Silicon macOS by `scripts/check-android-host.sh`
(`uname` check), plus Mac-specific paths: JDK `Contents/Home`, NDK
`prebuilt/darwin-x86_64`, Homebrew `dotnet@8`. The host check also requires the
emulator and system images, which a build does not need. Estimated work:
host-neutral paths and a build-only host check; Windows via WSL2 for the bash
scripts. Not built on Linux/Windows tonight (Docker daemon not running; the Mac
was under another agent's build).

Concrete plan (surveyed 29 Sep, not implemented): the Mac assumptions sit in
about 15 `scripts/*android*.sh` files and follow four patterns. Add one sourced
helper, `scripts/android-host.sh`, that sets per host: `JAVA_HOME`
(`.android-bootstrap/jdk-*/Contents/Home` on macOS, `jdk-*` on Linux), the
default SDK root (`~/Library/Android/sdk` vs `~/Android/Sdk`), the NDK prebuilt
directory (`darwin-x86_64` vs `linux-x86_64`) and a `sha256` function
(`shasum -a 256` vs `sha256sum`). Pin a second Temurin JDK archive and
SHA-256 for linux-x64 in `android-toolchain-versions.sh` and select it in
`bootstrap-android-host.sh`. Split `check-android-host.sh` into build
requirements (SDK platform, build-tools, NDK, CMake, JDK) and device/emulator
extras, and accept `Linux x86_64` for builds. Verify first on a Linux x86_64
machine or container, then Windows through WSL2.

## S3. Runtime-only APK plus player module

**Verified 29 Sep 2026 (emulator, Android 16 / API 36, targetSdk 36):** an app
copied a native library into its private `files/` directory and loaded it with
`System.load`. That library depended on a library shipped in the APK, its static
registrar called into the host library at load time, and JNI calls in both
directions worked (`PACKPROBE OK ... registered=42 value=70`). This is the
KartPad game-pack pattern, so the empty APK can keep the owner's signing key and
normal in-place updates. The re-signing route below is no longer needed for
Android.

Android 10+ restricts executing code from an app's writable data directory for
apps targeting API 29+; whether `dlopen` from app storage is reliable is
*unverified* and not relied on. Preferred route mirrors iPhone: insert the
player's module into the runtime APK's `lib/arm64-v8a/` on the computer, then
zipalign and sign with a key generated on that machine (`apksigner`,
cross-platform). Requires the same module split as S1.

## Resulting direction

1. Now: Mac builds everything (iPhone/iPad, Mac, Android) through PadMint.
2. Next: host-neutral Android builds (Linux, then Windows via WSL2).
3. Then, owner decision: runtime-only public apps plus player-built modules,
   starting with BlueWake (already split), then KartPad after a module refactor.

## D15. Any device from any computer is the goal; off-Mac work is paused (owner decision, 5 Oct 2026)

**The goal.** PadMint lets anyone mint their own copy of a game on the hardware they
have, for the device they play on: an iPhone/iPad IPA from Windows or Linux, an
Android APK from a Mac or Linux, and so on, for every game in the catalog.

**Now: paused, by choice.** Players mostly ask for KartPad and BlueWake, and both
already ship ready-to-play downloads (KartPad: Android, iPhone/iPad, Mac; BlueWake:
Windows). Players rarely want a multi-hour build on a PC, and building every route
first would not create demand for it. Until that changes, PadMint's job is to make
the builds that exist work well:

- iPhone/iPad copies on an Apple Silicon Mac, for every buildable game.
- Mac copies where a game offers one (CTRPad, HaloPad).
- KartPad's existing routes: Android game data on Windows, Linux and Mac; iPhone
  builds on Windows and Linux (experimental).
- Windows players: the game's ready-to-play download where one is published
  (BlueWake). PadMint does not build Windows copies for them.

`scripts/audit-catalog.py` keeps these routes honest: it checks every game's
published recipe the way a player's PadMint reads it. Run it after any catalog,
recipe or PadMint change.

**Why the goal is large (technical debt).** Apple's iPhone SDK, which the
iPhone-specific parts of every app need (UIKit, Metal or GLES, audio, controllers,
the file picker), may only be used on Apple computers. Game code itself is plain
C/C++, and PadMint already compiles it for iPhone on Windows, Linux and Macs with
open-source parts (D12, D13). So an iPhone copy made off a Mac needs each game split
into a published app with no game code, built once on a Mac, plus a game library
compiled on the player's computer and inserted by PadMint (D14). PadMint's half
exists, and KartPad uses it end to end. The other half is in each game's code;
today most games build as one combined app. Families share the work:

| Family | Games | State on 5 Oct 2026 | Rough work |
|---|---|---|---|
| Harbour Masters engine (libultraship) | SpaghettiPad, HarkinianPad, MaskPad, StarshipPad, BrawlerPad, PaperPad | SpaghettiPad draft #29 builds the game library on Windows and Linux; a test copy reached its race demo on an iPhone | 2–3 days to finish SpaghettiPad, then 1–2 days per game |
| N64 recompilations | GoldenPad, AnnePad, BananaPad, BearBirdPad, DinoPad | Not split; the translator must also run on Windows and Linux (these read the ROM during the build) | 2–4 days for GoldenPad and the translator, then ½–1 day each |
| GameCube/Wii recompilations | BlueWake, SunPad, MeleePad (KartPad done) | BlueWake (#42) and SunPad (#57) build their library off a Mac in drafts | About a day for those two; MeleePad 2–3 days (Rust, extra files) |
| One-off engines | CTRPad, BellPad, BallPad, BarrelPad | Not split; CTRPad compiles everything as one unit (`main.c`) | 2–4 days each |
| Mac only by design | AgePad, HaloPad | Package or translate the player's own Mac/PC game | Not planned |

PadMint itself would also need: inserting several files into an app (MeleePad), a
release step that publishes each game's app without game code next to its recipe
and checks the pair, Windows install steps (Sideloadly), and an audit column for
off-Mac readiness. That is about 2–3 days. The whole catalog is roughly 4–8 weeks of
focused work, plus a device check per game. Android copies of games other than
KartPad need an Android port first, which none has. Publishing the apps without game
code for the decompilation ports changes D5 (recipe only) and needs an owner
decision.

Rejected shortcuts: building on a cloud Mac uploads players' game files and breaks
"nothing is uploaded"; extracting Apple's SDK to use on a PC breaks Apple's license.

**Revisit when** players ask for a specific game off a Mac, or a family's reference
port gets finished for other reasons. Start with the family that unlocks the most
games (the Harbour Masters engine, via SpaghettiPad #29). Tracking issue: #75. The
drafts stay open as they are.
